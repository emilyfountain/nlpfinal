Do what you are told
A Coyote was with Esha who was going to be in a fight. As Esha was getting ready, he told his brother, "Don't watch me even though you hear a lot of fighting. Don't even peek.” Coyote could not stand look- ing at his brother. He heard the fighting outside the teepee and decided to peek through a little crack. At that instant his brother was shot and fell to the ground.
Esha's enemies roasted him, then celebrated their victory by dancing. Coyote tracked them to the dance. He waited until they were feasting. He knew he had to get one of his brother's bones. When they weren't looking, he grabbed a bone. He carried it with him everywhere he went. At night he would bury it in the ground. He did this for several days because his nosiness had caused his brother's death. He wanted to make up for it by carrying the bone with him.
One morning he heard a voice tell him to build a campfire. At first Coyote thought he was hearing things but the voice spoke again! Coyote - looked around the camp, then realized the voice belonged to Esha. He gathered some wood and built a big fire. His brother had come back to life. Coyote was so happy to see him alive that he did everything his brother wanted without complaining.
Long ago there was a young man who lived with his grandmother. Nobody liked to be around him because he was always having accidents. 
His neighbor had two daughters and they were very pretty. Na-See-Natchez wanted to marry one of them. He asked his grand- mother, “What do I do when I want to marry one of these girls?” She told him, “Visit their parents and if they want you to marry one of their daughters, they will let you stay the night.” So the young man sat at the opening of the tepee. He sat there all evening until his head was nodding. He was going to sleep. The father told his daughters to let him sleep with them so that Na-See-Natchez would not get cold.
During the night the young man had an accident. He wet the bed. The girls threw him out of the bed and told him to go home. The young man cried and cried on his way home. The next day he told his grandmother he was going away to the mountains. He told her, "If you hear thunder, stay in the tepee and don’t look outside.” He went into the forest and cried his heart out. The Great Spirit heard him and gave him horses and many other gifts. Na-See-Natchez was rich!
Thunder roared as Na-See-Natchez came off of the mountain. His grandmother heard the thunder and remembered her grandson's wish. She did not look outside. When the young man arrived he showed his grandmother the pretty gifts. When the sisters heard that Na-See-Natchez was rich they tried to be friendly, but he just ignored them. They were sorry they had kicked him out of their house. They knew they should treat everybody the same, no matter what kind of person he is.
A bear and her two cubs lived close to a deer with two fawns. The animals were camped near their yapah digging grounds. Yapah is a tasty root the Paiute Tribe gather when available. Everyday when the deer family went digging the bear checked for lice on the mother deer's neck. This made the mother deer very nervous. She told her children, “One of these days the bear will probably kill me. She is checking my neck too often. If this happens I will not return home that night. If I do not return, you should leave right away.”
One day the bear bit the deer's neck and killed her. That evening the bear packed all of the deer meat into her digging sacks and returned to camp. When she arrived she told the deer children, “Your mother has found a lot of yapah and is going to camp there overnight. She will start digging in the morning.”
The fawns suspected something was wrong. They cried for their mother when they saw the bear cubs eating meat. The cubs laughed and teased the fawns. The fawns decided to get even by killing the bear cubs. They planned to do away with them. The next day mother bear loaded her sacks to go digging and she left the children alone.
The fawns told the bear cubs that they would play a game with them. Everyone was to help dig a hole. They built a fire to make smoke. The fawns challenged the bear cubs to see who could stay in the smoke the longest. When the bear cubs could stand the smoke no longer they were supposed to call out, "Smoke! Smoke!” and the fawns would let them out for air. They took turns playing the game until the bear cubs went in and the door was closed. Soon the bear cubs cried out, "Smoke! Smoke!” but the fawns ignored them. Overcome by the smoke, the cubs suffocated.
The fawns then took the cubs and put them by their camp as if they were standing up. The fawns made hoof tracks in the dirt so mother bear would get confused. They had time to escape before the mother bear came home.
When mother bear got home she sensed that something was wrong as she dumped her bags. Finally she figured out which way the tracks were headed and followed them.
The fawns were resting in a pine tree when they looked back and saw her in the distance. She caught up with them and begged them to come down. She told them their mother had come home and wanted to see them. The fawns knew this was a trick and didn't pay any attention to her. After mother bear begged and begged, she finally fell asleep under the pine tree. Seeing mother bear asleep, the fawns broke branches and threw them on her to see if she was really asleep. They kept doing this until they were sure she was fast asleep. Then they jumped out of the tree and ran away.
The mother bear woke up and chased them. The fawns came to a big river and knew it was too swift to swim across. The bear was about to catch them! They saw a crane fishing along the bank so they asked, "Uncle, can you fly us on your back across the river?” He said, "Sure, get on.” He took them over the river and flew into the woods. When he left them he said, "Stay here where you have cover.” The crane also warned them about people. "Don't be afraid of people who sing and whistle as they walk through the woods. They will not harm you. Beware of the person who walks silently. He is the one who will harm you.” The crane returned to the other side of the river.
