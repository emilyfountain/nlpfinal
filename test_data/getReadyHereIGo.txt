Get ready-- here I go: a building blocks picture book for four-year-olds
One quiet morning in Apartment 5B, Luis García woke up with a great idea. “I’ve got to tell Mamá and Papá what I've been thinking,” he said to himself.
“What's wrong?” asked Mamá. “..Qué pasa?” asked Papá. “What's going on?” called Tía Lucia from down the hall. “Is someone hurt?” asked Luis's abuelo, Papá Grande, as he walked toward them.
“No one's hurt," said Luis to his grandfather. “I just wanted to tell Mamá and Papá about the five steps.”
“Cinco?” asked Tía Lucia as everyone settled on the bed. “Sí,” answered Luis. “There are five steps I need to follow so I can get ready for school.”
“Step 1 is the hardest,” began Luis. “I have to get out of the bedroom without waking Carlos. If I don't tiptoe out the door, he will start crying.”
“Step 2 happens in the bathroom. First, I go to the potty. I always remember to flush, but Papá likes to remind me to do it anyway.”
“Then, I wash my hands and face.”
“Step 3 is getting dressed. I pick out what I want to wear. I put my clothes on all by myself, but I let Mamá tuck my shirt in because she likes to help.”
“When I'm all dressed, I like to peek in the mirror to see how good I look.”
“In step 4, it's time to eat. I get out my bowl and spoon and cereal. Abuelo gets the milk for both of us.”
“Then comes the best part. Abuelo talks to me about growing up in Mexico and I tell him about the things I do at school.”
“Step 5 is the very last one. While Papá gets ready, I brush my teeth up and down and inside and out.”
“Then, Papá and I grab our coats and together we zoom out the door.”
“Esto es todo,” said Luis. “Five steps and I'm ready for school.” “ Fantástico!” said Tía Lucia as she gave him a hug.
“Can I try my five steps now?" asked Luis. “We all want to see the five steps in action,” said Papá with a grin, “but today is Saturday. The only step I want to take right now is to go back to sleep. Monday morning will be here soon enough.”
“Okay," agreed Luis as he walked back to his room counting very softly, “Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco ...”
