How Cottontail lost his tail
Long ago the animals were like people. They talked and walked and did the same things people do.
In those days the cottontail rabbit had a long tail. He had hands and walked on his hind legs. When he was small, he did not listen to anyone. He was like a very naughty boy.
Cottontail would not carry the water or build a fire when he was asked. He would not help anyone. His grandfather, Old Coyote, would warn Cottontail not to wander too far from camp. But Cottontail did not listen.
Cottontail and his grandfather lived beside a big river called the Columbia River. They would spear fish from the river. The homes were built of cedar poles and cedar bark.
Nearby lived a monster in a cave. The animal people were very frightened of him. He was so big! And he had such a big mouth!
One day Cottontail went walking beside the river to look for arrowheads. But he went too far, coming very close to the cave where the monster lived. The monster saw Cottontail. Quick as a wink, he sucked him right up into his stomach!
It was getting dark, and the crickets were beginning their evening songs. Cottontail still had not come home. Grandfather Coyote watched for Cottontail. He was worried that Cottontail had been caught by the monster!
Grandfather Coyote walked to a little stream. Growing near the stream was a firemaking vine. Grandfather Coyote cut the vine and put it in his belt. He climbed up a tree.
From the top of the tree he could see the cave where the monster lived. Grandfather Coyote took the firemaking vine from his belt and used it to tie himself to the tree. Then he called the monster!
The monster came stomping out of his cave! He looked this way. He looked that way.
When the monster saw it was Grandfather Coyote calling him, he sucked in his breath. He sucked harder and harder until the vine rope broke. Poor Grandfather Coyote was sucked into the monster's stomach.
Grandfather Coyote was old and wise. He had a flint knife, some pitch and a piece of the firemaking vine with him. He built a fire. As the light from the fire became brighter, he saw Cottontail.
Then he saw Skunk, Porcupine and Beaver, and all the other animal people that had been swallowed up. They were weak, for they had no food or water.
Grandfather Coyote saw the heart of the big monster hanging from above. He told the animal people to be ready to crawl out of the monster's mouth. Grandfather Coyote then cut off the monster's heart.
As the monster died, his mouth opened and shut. Each time his mouth opened, someone crawled out.
Grandfather Coyote and Cottontail were stronger, so they waited till the weak ones were out before they left.
Cottontail went out last, just as the monster took his final breath. The monster closed his mouth right on Cottontail's tail and pulled it off.
To this day, Cottontail has a short tail. But, he minds better and does what he is told.
