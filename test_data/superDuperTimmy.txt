Super Duper Timmy Cooper : a building blocks picture book for five-year-olds
Timmy Cooper always jumped out of bed early on Saturday mornings because that was the day he and his dad went to their neighborhood park together. Sometimes Timmy's dog, Duke, went along.
In the park, Timmy played on the slide and swings and seesaw, but that wasn't enough. "What I want to do is climb to the top Of the jungle gym, do a flip and jump to the ground without falling over," he told his dad. "That's my biggest wish."
"Then I'll help you," said Timmy's dad. "If you keep practicing, you'll get your wish. Let's get started by climbing to the top." Timmy practiced climbing over and over again. Finally, he made it to the top. "That's terrific, Timmy!" said his dad.
The next time they went to the park, Timmy's dad showed him how to flip. Timmy tried very hard, but he just couldn't flip all the way over. "I can't do it," Timmy complained to his dad. "My wish will never come true." "Just keep working at it, Timmy," said his dad. "You'll get there."
That evening, while Timmy and his mom were reading his favorite superhero stories, he had a great idea. Maybe if he wore a cape like Hawk Man, he'd be able to flip over. After they finished reading, Timmy found a big blue towel, tied it around his shoulders and stood in front of his mirror. "This ought to do it," he said happily. Then he put his new cape away.
Timmy wore his beautiful blue cape the next time he and his dad went to the park. As he ran toward the playground, his cape flew out behind him. "Let me hold the cape, Timmy, so you don't hurt yourself," said his dad. Timmy climbed right to the top of the jungle gym and, after several tries, he flipped all the way over. â€œGood job, Timmy!" said his dad. "Now, the next step is to learn to land without falling."
Timmy's dad showed him how to bend his knees and raise his arms to keep his balance. Sometimes Timmy remembered to bend his knees; other times he raised his arms. But he had trouble doing both at the same time. "My wish isn't coming true no matter how hard I try," he said. He was sO disappointed, his dad took him to the zoo on the way home.
That night, before he went to bed, Timmy decided he needed more help to make his wish come true. "Maybe if I spin three times and say secret words like Hawk Man does, I'll get my wish," he said. He spun around in a circle and shouted: "Crackity crack! Kaboom Kapow! Make me super duper now!"
The next time Timmy and his dad went to the park, they took Duke with them. Before Timmy started climbing the jungle gym, he spun around in a circle and repeated the magic words: "Crackity crack! Kaboom kapow! Make me super duper now!"
Timmy gave his cape to his dad and climbed the jungle gym. When he reached the top, Timmy swung his legs, took a deep breath, flipped and jumped. He landed perfectly. "Look Dad!" he yelled. "I'm doing it! I flipped and landed without falling!" "That's terrific, Timmy!" said his dad, as he handed Timmy his cape. "All that practice really paid off." "Now I'm Super Duper Timmy Cooper," said Timmy proudly.
The next day, while Timmy was playing with his dog, he had an idea. "Come here, Duke," he said, scratching the dog's ear. "Now that I'm Super Duper Timmy Cooper, I need a super sidekick just like Hawk Man's. Maybe you can be Mighty Mutt and do tricks for me."
Timmy tied an old blue scarf around Duke's neck, just like Hawk Man's cape, and whispered the secret words into Duke's ear: "Crackity crack! Kaboom kapow! Make Duke super duper now!"
Then Timmy picked up a ball and rolled it across the room. "Okay, Mighty Mutt," he said, "fetch!"
Duke looked at Timmy, looked at the ball and ran to the window and barked at some birds. Then he crawled under the bed and hid. "Something's wrong," thought Timmy as Duke crept slowly from under the bed. "Maybe Mighty Mutt didn't hear me." Then Timmy yelled the secret words: "Crackity crack! Kaboom kapow! Make Duke super duper now!"
He rolled the ball again, pointed at Duke and said, "Fetch, Mighty Mutt, fetch!" Duke didn't move. "Hmm," thought Timmy, "I bet I don't have the cape on right." He retied the scarf around Duke's neck and straightened it. "Get ready, Mighty Mutt. Good boy, now, fetch!" Ordered Timmy. The dog Sniffed and ran out the bedroom door.
"The super magic isn't working," grumbled Timmy. "Mighty Mutt is still just a plain old dog." He put his blue cape away and Curled up on his bed, discouraged.
When it was time for lunch, Timmy wasn't very hungry. "Is something wrong?" asked his dad. "You're not eating much." Timmy told his parents what happened with Duke. "I wanted Super Duper Timmy Cooper to have a super sidekick," said Timmy, "but the magic didn't work."
His mom gave him a hug. "Don't worry, Timmy," she said. "We know how much you want Duke to obey and do tricks, but magic isn't the answer. It wasn't the cape or secret words that made you Super Duper. It was lots of practice and hard work."
"Remember how many times we went to the park?" asked his dad. "It was a long time before you could climb to the top and hang from your knees and land without falling. Duke needs plenty of practice just like you did. Let's work together with him starting this afternoon."
Timmy smiled at his mom and dad. "In a minute," he said. "First I have to eat my lunch."
