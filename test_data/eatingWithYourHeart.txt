Eating with your heart in mind
Grandma feels great, and dad even rides bikes with me now. But last year my dad had a heart attack. My grandma had heart problems too. I never knew why they talked so much about cholesterol and eating less fatty foods. My dad had high blood cholesterol (ko-LES-ter-al). The doctor said that is why he had a heart attack. High blood cholesterol is one of the things that might cause a heart attack. It is also something you can not see or feel. My dad never knew he had it. If he had known, he could have done something to lower it. This would have helped prevent his heart attack. Kids our age can have high blood cholesterol too. We are too young to have a heart attack now. Later on when we grow up maybe we could. So my doctor measured my blood cholesterol. It turned out to be high, over 200 mg/dL. Of course, I was not sick. I was really pretty healthy, and I wanted to stay that way. I learned what to do to stay healthy. I do the same things dad did to get better. At my age that is easy. Of course, I do not smoke and I never will. I eat right and get plenty of exercise. Everyone else in my family does too. Eating right and getting exercise can help keep us healthy. When you take good care of things, they last longer. Mom makes sure we all eat right, but she lets us help. We have a lot of fun planning what to eat. We make lists and shop together. Sometimes she tries what I want. Sometimes I try what she wants. Eating right is easy now that I know what to do. Dad makes sure we get plenty of exercise. Sometimes the whole family rides bikes or hikes together. Sometimes I play kickball with my friends. And other times I just skate by myself. I like to read and watch TV too, but I always make sure I get plenty of exercise. They live happily ever after...
Arteries are vessels like pipes that carry blood. Choles- terol is like wax that can build up inside them. After many years the arteries can become clogged. This blocks the ﬂow of blood. If this happens in the arteries to your heart, your heart does not get enough food and oxygen. This might cause a heart attack. This is what happened to the dad in the story.
