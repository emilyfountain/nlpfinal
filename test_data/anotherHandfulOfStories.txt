Another handful of stories
The Sonic Boom of 1994 Mervin D. Garretson Back in the 1970s there was an airplane called the Supersonic Concorde. This plane could fly from New York to England or France in three hours. The speed was called Mach 2, which meant the plane traveled about 1,300 miles an hour. People in the United States were still not happy or satisfied with this speed. Many business people and government people wanted to cross the Atlantic Ocean in just one hour. If they could fly to Paris or London in one hour, then they could live there and work here, or live here and work there. It would be much easier to commute back and forth and much faster. Also, the people of France, England, and the United States could share their ideas and cultures. The U.S. government thought about this idea for a while. Then it gave a great deal of money to the aircraft industry to investigate, analyze, and develop an even better plane than the Concorde. This job took many years of planning and at least two full years of production work. May 1, 1994, was a very important day in the United States—the new plane (the SSC-F4) was completed. This ultrasonic plane could fly to England in only one hour. That was really FAST. People flocked to the John F. Kennedy airport in New York to see the new plane. Newspaper reporters, radio and TV people, business people, and high government officials all converged at the airport to watch the new SSC-F4 take off. United States President Jackson Graves sat in the Oval Office at the White House with his cabinet members and watched a huge TV screen. Workers in factories, hospitals, schools, and colleges all had the day off to watch TV and see the big ultrasonic plane take off. All over the United States, and even other parts of the world, people were watching TV. When the time came, the plane opened its jets and roared into the sky. The power seemed equal to 100 Boeing-747 airplanes. The plane zoomed off fast. In just a few seconds it reached the speed of sound. (The speed of sound is called the sound barrier.) When the plane broke the sound barrier it made a loud noise—a sonic boom. Such a sonic boom had never happened before. Every person in the United States heard this boom. They continued to sit and watch their TV sets as the plane went up into the sky. President Graves looked around the room at his cabinet members. He had a big smile on his face. He said, "Our experiment with the new airplane seems very successful. The takeoff was beautiful." The cabinet members looked at the president strangely, saying nothing. The president looked around the room again and said, "Our experiment seems very successful, right?" The cabinet members continued to stare at him. Finally, the Secretary of Health said, "Excuse me, Mr. President, but we can't understand you." Now it was the president who was looking at him, saying, "I don't understand you." All of the cabinet members suddenly began talking and looking around at each other in a frightened way.They could not hear each other. It was all very confusing. One cabinet member picked up a telephone and dialed, but she heard no sound. She hung up, still wondering what was going on. The Secretary of Health wrote a note and handed it to the president. "It seems we all have temporary deafness from that sonic boom. We had better call the White House doctor." The cabinet members and the president agreed. They sat and waited for the message to get to the doctor. While the president sat in the Oval Office, the vice-president sat in a meeting in the U.S. Senate. Everyone looked up at him, but they didn't understand a word. When the senators realized they could not hear each other, they became frightened. Things became very con- fusing and everyone panicked. The senators were really scared; they began to gesture and yell. After a while a telex came in from govern- ment officials. The telex said that all men, women, and children in the United States had become totally deaf from the sonic boom. They were shocked. What had happened to the country? The United States had become a nation of deaf people. There was not one hearing person left in the United States, only deaf people. In the department stores and other business places, clerks used big pads of paper so people could write notes. Radio sales and related businesses went down. People turned on their television sets, but they could not hear anything and they became discouraged. Telephone operators sat back and didn't work all day. Telephones did not ring. The operators just sat and drank cof- fee all day. Once in a while they would get a switchboard call through the TTY. But other than that, it was a very quiet country. People didn't know what to do or how to handle their deafness. The president of the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) called his board members on the TTY to set up a meeting in Washington, D.C. The NAD board members, who had always been deaf, flew in from all parts of the country for the meeting. The NAD president an- nounced, "We had better have a meeting with people at the White House. We need to help our country." All agreed he was right. They sent a telegram to the president of the United States. President Graves read the telegram that explained the NAD would be happy to help—"We've lived with deafness all our lives and you are kind of confused by it." The president of the United States became excited. He sent a wire back to the NAD saying, "Please, do come and help us out." All of the cabinet members came to the White House to meet with the NAD president and his board. They were aware of how easy it was for the NAD board members to sign back and forth, while they slowly wrote notes back and forth to each other. The U.S. president commented on how fast the NAD people could communicate. At the end of the meeting, President Graves announced that the NAD should set up a national program for teaching sign language to all the people of the country. So, the NAD selected skilled deaf teachers to teach the newly deafened population. At colleges, schools, and businesses everywhere, people began to learn sign language. The job market improved for deaf people already fluent in sign language. The others were out of luck; even the interpreters could not hear! People removed their car radios and replaced them with TV screens. They also removed their car horns and installed lights like on an ambulance or fire truck. Things changed all over the United States in many different ways. In the fall it came time for the national elections. People who had been deaf all their lives and were skilled in signing turned out to be the best speakers. They won victories over those who had just lost their hearing and were inept at signs or knew no signs at all. So, one deaf person became governor of Maryland and another became governor of California. And, finally, in the ultimate contest, Tim O'Hara, president of the NAD, was nominated for president of the United States. He won by a landslide. And that is how we got our first deaf president of the United States. 1776: Deaf People's Contributions Roslyn Rosen We all know the United States is a free country today. We also know that more than two hundred years ago, American colonists fought to gain independence from England. But, do you know how it really started? Do you know how deaf people helped to fight and win freedom for America? Let me tell you. My great, great, great, great grandfather was born in Martha's Vineyard (near Boston, Massachusetts) in 1730. His name was Silence Dogood. At that time, many deaf people lived on Martha's Vineyard,more than in other parts of the country. Usually there is about one deaf person for each one thousand hearing people. But, on Martha's Vineyard there was 1 deaf person for each 155 hearing people. The hearing people accepted deafness as a natural thing. They signed and used total communication; there was no problem. When my great, great, great, great grandfather Silence Dogood lived, the United States was not a country yet; it was still thirteen colonies under the rule of the English government. You might know a famous man who lived at that time—Ben Franklin. He was a famous inventor, printer, scientist, and politician. He met my great, great, great, great grandfather and became fascinated with him. They wrote notes back and forth. Ben hired Silence Dogood to work with him. Ben did not really have a good education when he was growing up. But writing notes back and forth with my great, great, great, great grandfather helped Ben to become a skilled writer. Ben started writing articles for newspapers, but he felt people wouldn't really pay attention to him. So, he used the name Dogood as his pen name. My great, great, great, great grandfather worked with Ben Franklin in his print shop and they wrote the newspaper the Pennsylvania Gazette. After a while, Ben decided to hire more deaf people. Writing notes gave him a really good idea; it made him think about establishing a post office so that everyone could send notes. And that's how the post office system got started in the United States. In those days, the United States was under the control of the English Parliament (government). Parliament tried to increase taxes. The colonists became angry because they were not allowed to vote. Parliament sent British soldiers to the colonies to make sure that the colonists did not fight or complain. One day in Boston in 1770, a col- onist tried to get a soldier's attention. The soldier did not respond, so the colonist threw a rock at the soldier. British soldiers immediately shot into the crowds and killed five citizens and wounded seven. When that news reached Ben Franklin, he said, "We have to put it right into the newspaper, that the British soldiers killed our people." But Ben was in a real hurry; he didn't have time to write the story down. So he just told the deaf printer, "Five people were killed and seven wounded by the British." The deaf printer prepared the headline, "5,700 People Killed in Boston Massacre!" The newspaper was printed and distributed. Ben Franklin returned to the shop, saw that headline, and said to the deaf printer, "No, that's wrong! I said 5, not 5,700! You're fired!" Many people who saw the newspaper became very angry. Before, they had thought, "Oh, so what, we don't mind paying a little bit of tax. No big deal." But, when the Boston Massacre happened, they started to get real upset. They wanted to be free from English rule. So they all gathered at the print shop and they said, "Ben Franklin, you're right about the British. We want to join the army. We can fight. We'll work together to be free." Then they all left. Ben Franklin then said, "This is great. I won't tell them it was a mistake. We want them to unite." The deaf printer said with relief, "Okay, but we need to communicate better. Can you learn sign language?" Ben Franklin replied, "Okay." So, he learned to sign a little bit. But it was really hard for him because it was so cold. Ben Franklin then invented the pot-bellied stove. And that's why the pot- bellied stove was invented—to keep the hands warm for signing! More and more people in the colonies started communicating with each other. They stood outside, talking and talking about the English control over the colonies. The English soldiers objected. They made it illegal for groups to assemble in public. Talking was not allowed! But you know you can't stop deaf people from talking on street corners. They just ignored the English. They talked among themselves and shared news such as, "Do you know what hap- pened? The English are going to increase our taxes. They're going to tax our tea." People started to complain. They didn't think that Parliament should increase taxes. "We have no voice. We object to taxation without representation. If they want to tax us, fine. But let us vote for it and support it or reject it. So, what should we do about it?" One colonist said, "Why don't we dress as Indians, sneak onto the English ship, and throw the crates of tea into Boston Harbor?" So a group of colonists went to the ship and threw the crates of tea into Boston Har- bor. The Boston Tea Party started the deaf people and hearing people working together. Hearing people looked up to deaf people in Boston. They were brave, rebelling against English rule. News of the Boston Tea Party arrived at Congress and made them announce war against England. Ben Franklin heard that Congress supported war against England to free the colonies. He ran to his print shop late, late at night in the  rain and cold. Ben didn't care, he wanted to get that headline, "America at War against England," into the paper. When he got to his print shop, he couldn't find his key. He remembered that his deaf assistant had a key. He went to his assistant's home that dark, cloudy night. He banged on the door but got no response. (At this time there were no doorbells or flashing lights for deaf people.) Ben was really stuck. He needed that key to open his print ship. Then he saw a light on the second floor. That meant the deaf assistant was in bed in that room. Ben thought of a plan. He got a big red kite. He let it up and tried to get it in front of his assistant's window. The deaf man noticed the kite, stuck his head out of the window, and saw Ben. "What do you want? It's midnight." Ben slowly signed, "I need key." The deaf man said, "I have the key, but I don't want to walk all the way downstairs. So, I'll just tie the key to the kite string. Okay?" Ben said, "Okay." So the deaf man grabbed the string and tied the big iron key onto the string. Just at that same moment the clouds broke open and lightning shot down and struck the key. The shock traveled down to Ben Franklin and he said, "I discovered electricity!" But we know that was really a deaf man's discovery. Deaf people really communicated well with each other during the Revolution. (You know how fast the news travels through the deaf grapevine.) They were good at getting out information and news about what was happening with the colonies and with the English. The American soldiers became known as Minutemen. That meant soldiers and communicators. The hearing and deaf soldiers worked together. Paul Revere was perhaps the best known Minuteman. He rode on his horse through the towns letting people know what was going on. One night the British soldiers were going to attack. The colonists didn't want to be surprised because they didn't have enough guns, bullets, or cannons. They didn't have many soldiers, but the British had many, many soldiers. The colonists didn't know which areas to protect. They had no idea if the British were coming by sea on a ship or by land on horses. Paul Revere said, "It doesn't matter. Someone can give me a signal. I'll just let you know, and then you can get together in the right way to protect yourselves." Nearby, there was a big church with a big bell. But Paul Revere could not hear, he was deaf himself. So, they used lights to give him the signal—"one if by land, two if by sea." When Paul Revere saw the number of lights, he rode his horse through the town to warn the soldiers and the Minutemen. The British could not beat the colonists, and no one died in that battle. In Concord, Massachusetts, there is a famous statue of a Minuteman standing with a gun. [By the way, the person who made that statue was Daniel Chester French. He also made the famous statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. If you look at that statue of Lincoln, you will see that his hands carry his initials — A.L. Daniel Chester French also made the statue of Thomas Gallaudet showing Alice Cogswell the handshape for the letter A.That shows you that the statues of Lincoln, Gallaudet, and the Minuteman are all related to deafness.] The famous battle of Bunker Hill was fought in 1775. You probably know about that battle. The colonists had several problems—not enough guns, not enough bullets, and not enough soldiers. There were only fifteen hundred American soldiers. They were inexperienced. They were farmers, printers, and so on. They were up against three thousand professional British soldiers who had plenty of experience and training. At Bunker Hill the American soldiers became nervous as they watched and waited for the British soldiers. Nothing happened. The deaf solders started talking and signing to each other. All of a sudden, they looked up—the British soldiers were almost on top of them! They grabbed their guns and fired. That really impressed General Gage. He said, "Wow, deaf soldiers really save ammunition. Okay, from now on the rule is: Do not fire until you see the whites of the enemies' eyes!" Tom Jefferson traveled through the colonies to see what was going on. He explained to the people that he wanted the thirteen colonies to become a free country. Tom Jefferson didn't know sign language. He had a difficult time communicating with deaf people, and deaf people had a hard time understanding him. Finally, he had to write everything down to explain what he meant. That paper became the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson wrote that famous paper in 1776. It was really written for the benefit of deaf people. But now, it's a very, very important paper for all Americans. The colonists continued righting battles with the British. They won another battle in 1777, the battle of Saratoga. Deaf people were thrilled. They were puzzled why Ben Franklin looked so unhappy. "What's the matter with you? We've won! You should be happy." Ben replied, "Oh I'm worried about the future. What will happen to us? We're using up all our guns and bullets. Our cannons are falling apart, and our soldiers are dying off. We don't have enough of anything. We really need to win this war. I've already gone to France several times, but...." And the deaf people said, "But what? What? What?" Ben said, "I just can't communicate with the French. They can't understand me." My great, great, great, great grandfather, Silence Dogood, said, "I'll go with you. I'll be your interpreter. I'm great at interpreting with other people in other languages. I'll have no problem." Ben cheered up and said, "Why not? We must have help from the French." Ben and Silence sailed to France and met with the government representatives and the deaf people there. My great, great, great, great grandfather signed to a deaf Frenchman who then spoke French to the French government officials. The government officials said, "Now we understand. We didn't understand what you wanted before. We will be happy to give money, supplies, and soldiers." Later, Ben and Silence went to Spain to talk to the king. With deaf people interpreting, they influenced the king to help, too. The king said, "I'll help America fight against England." England became very weak. The rest is history. You know the colonists won the war, they won their freedom. But, the question is, Could the United States of America have become a free country without the help of deaf people?

February 3rd Carl N. Schroeder On February 3rd the radio, TV, and newspaper people became very excited. There was a big announcement that someone had seen an unidentified flying object (UFO) through a telescope. This UFO was headed straight for Earth. Everybody went crazy. Nobody knew what was going on. Was it really a UFO? Why was it coming to Earth? No one knew. Everybody began talking about this UFO. Everyone watched the news to find out what was happening. Someone reported seeing a white flag on the UFO. A white flag was a truce symbol; it meant one side wanted to stop a conflict. No one knew what this white flag meant. Many different people, including religious leaders and politi- cians, got into great discussions about this. What would happen to Earth? Nobody knew the answer. The spaceship moved closer and closer to Earth. All of the world leaders—the presidents, the kings, the queens, the princes, even the Russians—got together to talk about the UFO. They asked questions like, What was going on with this UFO? Was it a spy ship? Could it be from another planet? Was there really life out there? The leaders did not know what to think, but they kept watching. All of a sudden the UFO stopped! Then, just as suddenly, all of the people—deaf people and hearing people—heard a voice. All of them understood it. The voice said that all the kings and queens, the pope, the religious leaders, and the political leaders must come to the UFO. But how? How could they get to it? The president of the United States said, "Oh, we have space shuttles. We have plenty of them. We can send all of the leaders up to the UFO." All the shuttles took off and went to the UFO. The UFO was huge. All of the space shuttles could land on it. The kings and queens and all of the leaders got out of the shuttles and went inside the UFO. They did not see anybody in the UFO, but they heard something that made them look up. There was a great big rectangle and a voice was speak- ing. It was speaking through this rectangle. It was not a loudspeaker. No, it was the rectangle itself, welcoming these people to the UFO called White Flag UFO. "We want to commend you for your wonderful work in behalf of your countries and for Earth. We want you to give us your recollections. Each of you tell a little bit about your country." The kings and queens, the presidents, and the pope were all amazed; they were really honored. They each told a little bit about how they served their people. Then, the voice said, "Now you must face the questions of the Council of Rectangles." All the leaders went into a great big council room. Instead of people, the room was full of rectangles; each rectangle was a different color. The rectangles were arranged in a semicircle. They asked very intelligent questions. These rectangles asked about peace and war and love and hate—really high-level, abstract, important questions. After the question session, the Council of Rectangles began discussing something, but the Earth leaders could not understand what the rectangles were saying. Suddenly the council announced that only two people had answered questions well—the pope and the very young princess. "Those two will now go back to Earth," the council said. "All of the others of you will have to be punished. You are going to be taken out of here." So the pope and the young princess were flown back down to Earth, and the UFO took off. No one knew where it went—it just took off, disappearing within a second. The pope and the princess were really sad, naturally. When the pope and the princess landed lack on Earth, no one came to get them out of the shuttle. Nobody! So they opened the door by themselves. As they opened it up and walked off the shuttle they realized that there had been a nuclear war. When all of the leaders had gone up to the UFO, the people on Earth had pushed the panic button and destroyed everything. And so these two were the only two people left on Earth. They looked at each other; could they be the new Adam and Eve? Fire in a Tree H. Paul Menkis One evening a father was sitting in the living room. His little daughter came up to him, sat on his lap, and said, "Daddy, tell me a story." The father said, "What story do you want me to tell you?" The little girl said, "I don't know; you choose a story." The father said, "I really don't know what story to tell you." The little girl looked around the room. Then, she noticed the fire in the fireplace. "Tell me how the fire burns from the wood," she said. The father thought about that for a few minutes and said, "Okay. I know how I'll explain it to you. Ready?" The little girl nodded her head. She was all ears and all eyes. The father began, "A long, long time ago, that wood you see there was a large tree. Prior to that, the tree was as small as you. And before that, it was merely a seed. It had been dropped into the soil, watered by the rain, and nourished by the soil, and it had grown bigger and bigger. One day the tree branches sprouted leaves. The leaves ab- sorbed the sunlight, and the sunlight filtered down into the rest of the tree. While that happened, the tree grew wider and taller, and many more branches grew out of it. "Over the years the tree absorbed a lot of sunlight. The sun is very far away. Now suppose a tree were to touch the sun, what would hap- pen? The tree would burn up! But even from far away, the sunlight nourishes the tree. The tree absorbs all the heat, which filters down into the roots. The tree stores the heat for many, many years. Later, when the tree gets old or people need the tree, someone chops it down and cuts it into logs. You know, logs just like the ones we have right here in the fireplace. "Now, those logs, or wood any place, can be lit by striking a match and holding it to the wood. The match makes the wood wake up. It comes to life; it burns. Now what does all this mean? That wood, which has been taking in the heat from the sun year after year, has been waiting for you. All you need to do is strike a match. When the wood catches on fire, it gives you that heat from the sun. And that's how we get fire." The little girl was fascinated with this. She thought about it as she walked off to bed. She continued to think about it. How interesting it was—taking in the heat and giving us warmth. How wonderful it was that trees did that for us. The little girl fell asleep. The next morning the sun on her face woke her up. Immediately she thought of the trees. She got out of bed and dressed quickly. Then she ran outside and looked in awe at the trees. She touched one, she hugged it, and she kissed it. 
The Chalk Carl N. Schroeder I died and my soul went up to heaven. I walked up to the golden gate and tried to open it, but it was locked. I noticed a doorbell, so I pressed the doorbell and I waited and waited—I waited a long time. I couldn't really see much through the gate because there was a hill. I became really curious about what was on the other side.  I waited a long time by the gate. It seemed really strange that no one answered, so again I pushed the button. I waited and waited until finally an old man walked up. He had a long white beard. I didn't know what to do, so I just stood there. I waited until the old man came up and said, "May I help you?" I answered, "Yes, I just died and now I'm here." The old man said, "Oh! What is your name?" I fingerspelled, "J-o-h-n K-o-l-a-t-a." He said, "But I don't know your name." So I said, "Who are you?" "I'm Peter." "Oh, I've heard of you down on earth. You're very famous." "Yes, but I really don't know you." "You don't know me?" "No, I don't know who you are." "But, I just died a little while ago and now I'm a soul. You're not expecting me?" Peter said, "No. What is your name again?" So I fingerspelled again—"J-o-h-n K-o-l-a-t-a." "I don't know you." "I'm shocked," I said. "There must be a mistake." He said, "Yes, it must be a mistake. Well let's see.. .I have a book that lists all people's lives. It's in my house. Why don't you come with me into the house." That was fine with me. Peter opened the gates and we walked in. It smelled so good, just like the morning dew, like sweet flowers, I thought as we walked. Then we went into the house. There were rows and rows of books on the wall. The old man stood near the books and asked, "What is your name again?" I spelled Kolata. He found the book and asked, "What year were you born?" I told him, and then he looked for my name, but he couldn't find it. He wanted to know where I was born so I explained, but he still couldn't find it. Finally, he said, "I don't know who you are." "What do you mean you don't know me?" "I'm sorry," he said as he closed the book and put it back. I said, "There must be a mistake. What's wrong?" Peter said, "Well, have you ever sinned?" "Well I thought I was forgiven for all my sins, but..." "Well, you can be forgiven. I will tell you how." And then he brought me some chalk, a great big piece of chalk. He explained, "Now with this chalk you have to make Xs for all the sins you ever committed. Put the Xs on the steps outside of the gate." "You mean Xs on all the steps?" He answered yes. So I went outside and Peter said, "Good luck and make sure you get all of your sins taken care of before you come back." "Okay," I responded. I thought about my sins and I made one X. Then I remembered another sin, made another X, and on and on all the way down this long staircase. I made Xs and Xs that went on forever. And then I saw an old friend. He was walking toward me. I wondered what he was doing walking up the stairs. I didn't really want him to notice me. I was sort of embarrassed about what I was doing. I tried to hide myself, but on these stairs there was absolutely no place to hide; I was stuck. So I went up to him and I asked, "Oh, what are you doing?" He looked at me and said, "Well, how are you doing?" "Oh, I'm doing fine. I'm making these Xs for my sins." And my friend said, "So am I. I have to go back up to heaven to get my third piece of chalk!" 
A Lucky Christmas Robert R. Davila John and Mary Noble lived in Vermont. Every day, John, who had worked as a fireman on a train before he retired, would get up and go out to the forest to chop wood. He would chop and chop away. Then he would bring the wood back home, stack some, and put the rest into the fireplace. His wife, Mary, used the fireplace to cook and warm the house. They had very little money, but they managed pretty well. One morning, near Christmas 1945, John was taking his daily walk to the woods when he noticed a dog running beside him. It was a beautiful Irish setter. John knew that it was a hunting dog. He looked around to see whose dog it was, but there was no one around. He looked at the dog once more and then went into the forest. John saw a good tree ahead of him, and he started hacking away at it. He noticed the dog was still circling around and around, look- ing at him and sniffing the ground. John left the dog alone and kept on chopping the tree. About half an hour later, he had chopped enough wood to last a few days. John only took home enough wood for one day. (He would go back and forth every day for as much as he needed.) He placed the wood in a sack, put it over his shoulder, and started to walk back home. The dog started to follow John. John patted the dog on the head and kept walking toward his home. He forgot about the dog again. When John got home, he made a fire in the fireplace and put the rest of the wood away. After a while, it was time to wake up his wife. She got up, prepared breakfast, and they ate. Then John went outside. The dog was sitting in the yard. John wondered to himself where in the world the owner could be. He called to Mary to come outside and see the dog. John explained that the dog had followed him into the forest and then followed him back home earlier that morning. He said that the dog was a most beautiful dog and Mary agreed. She, too, wondered where the owner might be. She said that the owner would probably come later to look for the dog. All day and into the evening, the dog stayed in their yard. John and Mary thought that it was not right to keep the dog. So they opened the gate, let the dog out, and shut the gate behind it. They yelled to the dog to go away. Then they went to bed and slept through the night. The next morning, John got up and dressed while his wife slept. He got his ax and started to go out to the forest to chop more wood. Just as he put the ax over his shoulder, he saw the dog in their yard again! John said to himself, "Boy, I love that dog and I also love to go hunting. Maybe he's a good hunting dog." So John went back into the house very quietly, put the ax back, and got his rifle.
He left the house with the dog. They went out, way out, into the forest, and they stayed all morning long. That dog was a wonderful dog indeed! He could point and do all the things a hunting dog was supposed to do. John shot birds and the dog caught a lot of them. He followed John all over the forest. When John arrived home, he didn't know how to explain this to Mary. But he had to try. When he woke her up, she said, "What is it?" She sat up and looked around the room. "Look at all the beautiful birds you caught. How did you get them?'' John explained that very early that morning he decided to go hunting with the dog instead of chopping wood. "I found out that the dog is a wonderful hunter, a great help to me." After a while, Mary noticed that John was taking the dog with him—encouraging the dog to follow him. She didn't feel that was right. One day when John came home for lunch, Mary came to him and said, "Come here, I want to discuss something with you. I don't think it's right to keep that dog. It's not our dog. You had better go to town and knock on each door until you find the dog's owner. We should give it back." John thought that maybe Mary was right, so he said, "Okay. I will go to town." That afternoon, John went to town. He knocked on doors but nobody knew anything about the dog. He went back home and said to Mary, "There is no owner." She replied, "Well, I think it would be a good idea to put an ad in the newspaper. Perhaps someone will look in the newspaper and see that a dog has been found. Maybe someone's heart is broken. Or maybe children are crying over their missing dog. It's better to be honest about the whole thing and put the ad in the newspaper." The next morning, John went to the newspaper office and explained that he wanted to put an ad in the newspaper. He found that it was cheaper to run the ad for seven days. So John put the ad in the news- paper for seven days. That evening, John opened up the newspaper and sure enough, there was his ad. After John finished reading the newspaper, he wanted to go hunting with the dog—he had gotten so attached to that dog, and he worried about that. It was getting very close to Christmas. People were very busy shop- ping. John and Mary had been working hard to get ready. Everything was prepared for their holiday celebration. But still there was no answer to John's ad in the newspaper. No one came to claim the dog. Maybe someone had moved, or had lost the dog, or didn't even care about it. If seven days passed, John would be able to keep the dog. On the seventh day of the ad, John felt anxious all day. He was working on the fence when he noticed a car on the road. This was unusual because there weren't many cars after the war. John saw that the car had pulled into his driveway. He started to feel quite depressed. The young man who was driving the car must have been less than twenty-five years old. When he got out of the car, John and Mary could see that he was dressed very nicely. It looked as if the young man was quite well-to-do. He went up to John and said, "Excuse me, are you Mr. Noble who advertised in the paper for the lost dog?" John said, "Yes, I am." The young man introduced himself, "My name is John Smith. I had a good hunting dog once, but I lost it. I thought perhaps you might have found my dog. May I see it?" John looked around to see where the dog might be. He saw the dog a good distance away and yelled to it. The dog ran over to where they were standing and started walking around their feet. John said, "Is this your dog?" The young man said, "I'm not sure, let me see. The dog has the same coloring as my dog—it looks very much the same. The dog has the same white dot on its forehead—looks almost identical. It's very hard to tell." John said, "Well, what's your dog's name?" "Henry." "Well," John said, "let's call out Henry and see if the dog responds." So the young man called out Henry, but the dog just looked up and looked back down on the ground and walked around. He called Henry again, and the dog didn't respond. Then John said, "The dog doesn't seem to be answering you." The young man said, "Well, I guess it's not my dog. It doesn't answer to its name. My dog would answer that name immediately and look up." John said that he was sorry. "Do you live around this area?" The young man said yes. The young man then asked John if he had a dog. He also asked John if he ever went hunting. "No, I don't have a dog, but yes, I have been hunting. Just a couple of days ago the dog and I went out hunting. This dog is a wonderful hunting dog. I really enjoy hunting with that dog, but I have to find its owner." "That's not my dog," the young man said. "I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I thought maybe it was mine." John was quite relieved. He was glad that it wasn't the young man's dog. Now, he could keep it. When the young man started to leave, John reached out to shake his hand. The man explained that he couldn't use his right hand anymore, but he shook hands with John using his left hand. John pitied the man; he had been hurt in the war. The young man got in- to his car and left. John ran into the house and told Mary what had happened. "It wasn't his dog. Maybe it will be ours; maybe we can keep it." Mary said, "No, it's not ours. It's close to Christmas and someone might be heartbroken by the loss of that dog. We will have to wait one or two more days to be sure." John's hopes started to build again. On December 24th, the day before Christmas, John got up to go hunting with the dog. They returned with several birds. While John and Mary were talking in the yard, they saw a Western Union bicycle coming. Before and during the war, people became nervous when they saw a Western Union bicycle coming. They knew it was bring- ing bad news. The news would hurt; a soldier had been wounded or had died. Now the war was over, but the telegram might still have bad news for someone. The Western Union delivery boy came up to the house. John was scared to death. John knew the boy's name was Jimmy. John had seen him often. John said hello to Jimmy. "What are you doing here?" John asked. Jimmy replied, "Hi there, Mr. Noble. I have a telegram for you." "For me? I don't understand. Thank you, Jimmy." Jimmy got on his bike and left. John went into the house. John was afraid to read the telegram. So was Mary. They opened the telegram and read it together. They were surprised by the message. "Try to call it Lucky." The telegram was signed, "A Friend." Mary said, "Oh, it must mean the dog." They ran outside to try the name. The dog was standing a little ways off. John yelled out, "Lucky, Lucky!" The dog perked up its ears, ran towards John and jumped up on him. The dog licked John across the face. John had to push him down. It was the right name!  John thought about the telegram—how were the dog and the telegram related? Then John thought about the young man who had come yesterday—his right arm had been hurt in the war; he couldn't hunt anymore. Maybe that was why he didn't take the dog. John understood then. The Ideal Preacher Henry Holier My story begins with a young college graduate who became a preacher. He was a very good speaker. He got a job in a town where the church was not very big. This preacher always preached about positive things. He never talked about negative things like sin, trouble, and fire, and all those things. The church members liked the preacher very much—he made them happy and made them feel they were loved by God. They also liked him because he always limited his sermons to twenty minutes—never more, never less. He would stop right on the button, just twenty minutes. The entire service lasted one hour, which made the people quite happy. They never were bored. One day a friend asked the preacher how he managed to meet that twenty-minute mark every Sunday. "That's simple," he answered. "Before I start preaching I always take out a Life Saver and put it in my mouth. When the Life Saver is gone, I know my time is up." The preacher's reputation spread and the congregation grew. Many people came to hear this man preach. He made them so happy they gladly gave to the collection plate. They always went home happy. Now, if he had preached about hell and the devil and those things, they would not have liked it. They would not have been happy to give. Church attendance grew quite substantially. The church became quite crowded. The wife who had always complained to her husband about sitting so close, had to learn to sit closer. This couple grew to love each other more; they learned to love each other all over again. Even though the church got more and more crowded (the church windows looked like eyes popping out), it did not collect much money. The preacher could not afford fine suits, so he went to the store and bought a humble, medium-priced suit. His wife thought that three buttons on the jacket cuff made the suit look ordinary, but four buttons would make it look like an expensive suit. So, she added one more button to each cuff. One Sunday while the preacher was delivering his sermon, one of the buttons fell off. It dangled by a thread, so he quickly grabbed it and stashed it in his coat pocket. A few Sundays later, he was preaching away again. He had his Life Saver in his mouth, as usual, and he was sucking on it. But this Sunday the preacher talked for more than twenty minutes. He kept sucking his Life Saver and preaching. His wife noticed that the twenty minutes had passed, so she signaled to her husband that his time was up. The preacher was confused because he still had the Life Saver in his mouth, but he stopped preaching. After he sat down he took the Life Saver out of his mouth and got a big surprise. He had been sucking on the but- ton the whole time! The World's Largest Picture Carl N. Schroeder A long time ago there was a small village in the countryside. A river ran next to the village. The adults in the village worked out in the fields, tending to their crops and taking care of their farms. The children loved to sit and listen to an old man (the village storyteller) tell stories about many different things. Their favorite story was about the bridge that had been built many years ago by their forefathers. That bridge was very helpful to the village because it had opened up communication with the rest of the world. It was a very important bridge, and the people were very proud of it. One day, a little boy asked the old man where the world's largest picture was. The old man thought and thought, but he did not know the answer. "That's a good question," he said. "Where is the world's largest picture? Seems I'm going to have to travel to find out where the world's largest picture is. I'm going on a search. I'm going to cross the bridge and go out into the world to find the world's largest picture." The old man left the village and started traveling over mountains and deserts and valleys, all over the country. He went to many dif- ferent towns and asked many people where they thought the world's largest picture was. Some people said it was in the church and other people said it was in different places. It was very hard to find the ex- act location of the world's largest picture. So the old man continued his travels. On his way back home he met a salesman. The salesman had done quite a lot of traveling. The two men began to discuss their experiences. The old man told the salesman about his search for the world's largest picture. The salesman said he knew a little bit about that sort of thing. The old man listened and learned until, finally, he was ready to go back to the village. The old man knew the people would be excited when he came back. He thought they would decorate the bridge and cheer when he came over it. After all, he was bringing news of the world's largest picture. When the old man came back, the village had a celebration. All the people were ready to listen, so the man told his story. He described the trees and the clouds and the birds and the sun and everything he had seen. Finally, somebody asked, "But, where is the world's largest picture?" The old man answered, "It's right in your mind."

My Summer Experience Heimo I. Antila In 1933, while I was a student at Gallaudet College, two friends and I decided to work as dishwashers during the summer. Pop Nelson, George Brown, and I got jobs at the Hotel Warren in Spring Lake, New Jersey. One day near the end of the summer, Pop asked me if I could drive him to Asbury Park, New Jersey, so he could buy a pair of shoes. I said I was sorry, but I could not do it. He then turned to George and asked him to drive to Asbury Park. I asked George if he had a license. He said no, he was from Ohio where a license was not necessary. I was very naive and let him drive my car to Asbury Park. Two hours later George and Pop returned frowning and looking very glum. "What's wrong? What happened?" George Brown said, "Well, I drove your car through the train cross- ing barrier, and the barrier broke; and the train barrier smashed in the windshield of your car." I regretted letting them take the car. Then I wondered about the police. "Did anybody copy down the tag number of my car?" George said yes. I knew if I stayed in the state I would be liable for a $50 fine for let- ting someone without a license use my car. I approached the hotel steward and said, "I want to quit today. I have to go home; I received some bad news. I want my pay now." The steward started hassling with me. "No, you have to stay here. You have to stay until after Labor Day. We'll have great crowds of people coming. It will be hard for two people to do the work. We need all three dishwashers." "No, I must leave now," I replied. We argued for a while. Then an hour later he paid me. I took my money, packed my things, and drove off with the wind blowing in my face. I didn't feel comfortable at all because of the wind. I noticed a junkyard on the side of the road, so I pulled over and stopped. I went in and got the owner. I told him I wanted to see if he had a car like mine there—I wanted to buy the windshield from it. I asked how much it would cost, and he said $5. He told me to look for it myself. It was dark, so I used a flashlight to locate one. I found one, so I removed the windshield and put it in my car. After that I waved good- bye and drove to New York City. This was my first time driving in New York City in the middle of the night. When I noticed a red light several blocks away, I drove across several intersections until I got to the intersection where the red light was and then I stopped. I repeated this maneuver three or four times until a police officer caught up with me and cut me off. When the police officer started speaking to me, I motioned to him that I was deaf. He pulled out a pad of paper and started writing. Then, he handed me the pad. "When you see the red light way down there, five blocks ahead, you have to stop at the very next block. And do that every time you see it—stop at the next block. You gave everyone a bad scare. Some cars had to dart around you. You could have caused a tremendous accident on the street. Can you read English?" I answered, "Oh, yes I can. Are you going to give me a ticket?" "No!" "Thanks." I put the note in my pocket and drove out of New York City. On the highway I got stuck behind a garbage truck that smelled terrible. The truck had Connecticut tags. I waited for a chance to pass the truck. When I did, it passed me. I passed it again.. .it passed me again, too. I slowed up to put some distance between us, but the truck also slowed up. The driver must have wanted me to enjoy the smell—all the way to Bridgeport, Connecticut!  I arrived home in Massachusetts all right. When I returned to Gallaudet in the fall, I found a letter waiting for me from the New Jersey Central Railroad. I opened it up; it was a fine for breaking the train barrier—$16. Sixteen dollars? I didn't know where I was going to get $16. Then, I figured it out—George Brown had driven the car and hadn't watched where he was going, so he could pay $5, Pop Nelson had asked George to drive him so he could buy those shoes, so he could pay $5. And I was stupid enough to let them both go and do it, so I decided to go ahead and pay the balance of $6 to punish myself. 

My First Deaf Model Lynn Jacobowitz Let me tell you a bit about my background. I went to elementary and secondary oral schools. All of my teachers were oralists. I would read their lips and interpret to my classmates on the sly. I did not have my first deaf teacher until I came to Gallaudet College. Her name was Judy Williams. She taught English. The first day of classes I came into the classroom and sat down. The teacher walked in and started signing in ASL. I looked at one of my classmates and asked him if the teachers here signed. He said yes. The other students all nodded and said signs were allowed at Gallaudet. I didn't feel very comfortable with this; I still resisted sign language. The teacher asked us to write compositions. We all wrote short paragraphs, and the teacher taped them on the wall. We looked at each others' compositions; it was very interesting. The teacher then looked at them. The first one got an F. The next one got a D. Then an F, D, F, as she continued down the wall. We were all very de- pressed. This deaf teacher was really mean. I thought she didn't know anything about English. We started arguing among ourselves. The teacher slammed her fist on the desk and told us to pay atten- tion, to look at her. But I was still very resistant. She was signing, but I wasn't comfortable with that. She explained why the errors were there and I was very fascinated with her explanation. I was drawn to her, I felt she was my friend, yet I resisted for a long time. About a month later, I started to believe that she really was a good teacher. She increased my confidence in writing. Not only in writing compositions, but in writing plays and poetry, too. I wrote and wrote until I was deranged with writing. If it hadn't been for the fact that she was a deaf teacher maybe my writing would have gotten worse. I think it really pays to have deaf teachers for all subjects. I learned a lot from Judy Williams in a short time. She showed me it was important to have deaf teachers. She had a great influence on me. Sadly, she died in a freak car accident. I was quite depressed when I learned that news. But she will always be my first deaf model. Some Funny Things Happened along, the Way Thomas K. Holcomb Since my graduation from Gallaudet College two years ago, I have worked as a student recruiter for Gallaudet. My primary responsibility is to visit different schools for the deaf in the United States and speak to the students—explain to them about Gallaudet and why they should attend Gallaudet. During my travels to different states, many funny things have happened to me because of my deafness. For example, when I get on a plane, I like to sit by the window so I can look out. I never bother to look around me on the plane. One time a woman tapped me on the shoulder and started speaking, but I didn't understand her. So, I wrote her a note to ask her what she was trying to say. She said she was trying to make con- versation with me, but she thought I was a snob. Then I told her I was deaf and said I was sorry, and we both began talking. Looking back, I wonder how many people have tried to make conversation with me before. I guess I'll never know. Often when I travel on planes in the morning, I try to order orange juice. I'll order it and invariably I'll get a Coke. No matter how we try to communicate—with lipreading, gestures, and all that—I still get a Coke. That's sad. Just because I can't speak well. Oh well. One time I was traveling with another recruiter. We sat down in the airport to wait for the plane. We knew that the plane was very, very small, that it only had a few seats. We agreed that we would hurry on the plane and try to get two seats together. So, we waited near the hallway until we thought our plane was there. There was an announcement, so we ran down this long hallway to get onto the plane, but then we found out we were wrong; it was not our plane. We were embarrassed. All these people behind us were lined up and waiting. We had a hard time getting through the crowd back to the lobby. It was really embarrassing. So the next time we had to wait, we made sure that we had the right plane before we got on it. I had another interesting experience in California. I was supposed to visit a high school. On the morning of my visit, I got up, looked at my watch, and realized I was very late. I was all excited; I hurried to get my clothes on and get in my car and go. I even finished dressing in the car. As I was driving, it was dark and there was nobody on the road. I thought that was strange—there was no traffic at all. I made really good time. When I got to the school the fence was locked — it was closed and there were no cars inside. I looked at my watch; it was the right time for my appointment. As a matter of fact, I was a little bit late. And then all of a sudden I remembered the three-hour time difference between Washington, D.C. and California. I guess I was so tired I just forgot about the three-hour difference. So I drove back to my hotel, slept for a few more hours, and then got up, got ready, and arrived right on time. If I had been hearing maybe I could have asked a hotel clerk to call and wake me up on time. But I'm deaf. One thing I've noticed about schools with mainstreaming programs is that they are very much the same. When I go into the office and ask for the deaf department they say, "Oh, it's down this hall and around this way." Then they say they would be very happy to take me to this particular room. And always it's down this way and around the corner and all the way to the end of the building. At every school it's the same thing. I wonder why the deaf people are always put in the back and not in the front of the building. I have no idea. But it is an interesting observation—these programs are all the same. So you can see that many, many frustrating things happen to me, but they really make my job more interesting and more enjoyable. All in all, recruiting has been a wonderful experience. An Itchy Story Heimo I. Antila During my sophomore year in college, my fraternity (Kappa Gamma) planned a dance. While we were working in the Ole Jim, decorating the place, I felt that we ought to have some garland greenery hanging from the rafters. We discussed it and wondered where we could find garlands. "Oh," I said, "there's some in the woods on the Gallaudet campus, behind the farm." So we all got together and walked to the woods. The first tree we came to was a great, big, tall one with a green vine growing up it. I saw three leaves in clusters all around and I knew that it was poison ivy. I tried to dissuade my fraternity brothers from picking it. I told them that it was poison ivy. And the guys (they were upperclassmen) said, "Oh, you're stupid. That's Virginia Creeper." "Virginia Creeper? But my father told me that a three-leaf con- figuration is poison ivy." We started fussing at each other, and then I dropped the argument. I said I would help them. We pulled down the vines from that tree and carried them into the Ole Jim. We started decorating. After a while, Professor Drake showed up. He was curious to see what we all were doing in the Ole Jim. He looked at everything and said, "I'm a farmer. I know that's poison ivy you are handling. I teach agriculture here at the college." We looked at him and said, "Oh, you're in agriculture. Better call in Professor Allison who teaches botany. Maybe he knows more." Professor Allison came in and saw the poison ivy. He said, "I'm surprised at all of you, you are ignorant! Don't you know that a vine with three leaves is always poison ivy? Virginia Creeper has clusters of five leaves." I knew he was right; so I suggested we take all the poison ivy back to the woods. We put it over our shoulders again and carried it back to the woods. Well that evening at the Kappa Gamma dance, I noticed some of my fraternity brothers were missing. What happened to them? I found out they were in their rooms in College Hall, in bed, all swollen, itchy, red, and scratching themselves. The poison ivy had no effect on me. When I was a prep, I had ap- plied iodine to an abrasion on my elbow, which made it swell and look like poison ivy. The doctor had given me an injection that made me immune to poison ivy. What I am allergic to is iodine! 

My Life on Kendall Green Agnes Padden I always tell people that Kendall Green is my second home because I've lived or worked here almost all my life. I think I am the only person who has watched Kendall Green change over the years because I've never moved out of the Washington, D.C. area. I attended Kendall School and then I entered Gallaudet College as a preparatory student. I really had many happy years on this campus, especially at Kendall School and Gallaudet College. After I graduated from Gallaudet, I became a teacher and taught preschool at Kendall School. Then I worked at the Tutorial Center and later I transferred to the English Department, where I have been teaching for the past sixteen years. I remember when Kendall Green was "country" in the city. Everything was green, there were trees all around. The Kendall girls and I would take walks to the farm that was on one side of the campus. When I was in Kendall School, I lived in a dormitory on the campus. The dorm was House #4 (which is now the Office of Demographic Studies); it used to have a porch with a rail in front of it. On spring evenings after supper, we girls were allowed to go out and play for a while. We played on the half of the campus in front of the dorm—we rode our bicycles and roller-skated all the way up to the Ole Jim and then we turned around and came back to House #1 (the President's House). While we were out playing, the college girls and boys would be out walking past our dorm. The college girls could go outside after supper for Campus Hour. The college students walked in pairs all over the campus. When we saw the couples coming we all stopped playing, sat on the porch rail, and watched the couples walking by. These couples always stopped talking because they didn't want us to watch their conversations. They walked past us looking straight ahead. Once, our supervisor told us that we should not do this because the college girls said we all looked like chickens on the rail staring at them. During the winter the Kendall girls and I often saw the college boys playing near College Hall. One winter evening when there was deep snow, we saw the boys running back and forth, stark naked, in front of College Hall. So you see, there were streakers in the forties, which shows that streaking was not something new in the seventies. My college years were wonderful years. We had good teachers. I can recall vividly two of my teachers because they really influenced me. Dr. Elizabeth Peet, who was Dean of Women at that time, was a very refined woman. She was well mannered and dignified, and she tried to make ladies of all of us. Frederick Hughes was the other teacher whom I remember vividly. All the students loved him. He taught classes in dramatics and current events. During my senior year I decided to participate in a musical play that Professor Hughes was directing—The Mikado. I had a leading role in The Mikado. The play took place in Japan. Now, there was one scene in which my lover and I had to kiss each other. Professor Hughes didn't want us to do that in public because he was worried about what people in the audience would say. He knew Dr. Peet would be in the audience. He thought about how we could change that scene. For the play I wore a kimono and a black wig, so Professor Hughes decided to give me a Japanese fan. My lover and I practiced bowing our heads together behind the fan to make it look as if we were actually kissing. We practiced over and over again. On opening night, as we were doing this scene, I opened up the fan and my lover and I bowed our heads down behind the fan. Guess what happened? My lover kissed me so hard that I was stunned for a few minutes. I forgot my lines. I found out later that Professor Hughes was so surprised to see us actually kissing that he became flabbergasted and said, "No! No, no, don't do that." After that my lover decided to cooperate with Professor Hughes. He did not kiss me anymore. There was another incident that I remember clearly. Several of my classmates and I were hungry one afternoon. It was 2:30 and we were not allowed to go off the campus until 4:00. We wanted to get something to eat, so we thought we would go across the street to a corner drugstore and order sandwiches or ice cream sodas. When a girl wanted to go off campus, she had to sign her name in a book in the dorm. We all wondered if we should sign the book or let Dr. Peet get mad at us. We decided that we would just walk off the campus and come right back. Just as we all filed out of Fowler Hall (our dormitory), we saw Dr. Peet waiting to get across the street. We all turned around, ran back into Fowler Hall, and hid in the basement. We waited and waited. After a while the girls told me to go upstairs to see if Dr. Peet would say anything. I went all the way up to the third floor so I could pretend that I was just coming down from there. As I was coming down the steps, I saw Dr. Peet looking at the book that didn't have our names in it. Dr. Peet said to one of the students, "I saw many young ladies leaving the campus and they all ran back to the dorm. Do you know who they were?" She never did find out who tried to sneak off that afternoon. As I said before, Dr. Peet tried to make ladies of us. One afternoon I decided to chew gum while roaming in the hall. Dr. Peet came up to me and said, "Do you know it's not dignified for a young lady to chew gum in public? You look like a cow chewing its cud. Please go to your room and sit down and chew to your heart's content. Then, throw the gum in the wastebasket before you come out." There are many, many other things that I remember. I feel that Dr. Peet and Professor Hughes made my life very exciting. They gave me many memories to look back on. Douglas Craig, M.M. Heimo I. Antila I have a very interesting story about Douglas Craig, M.M. (That M.M. stood for Master of Mail.) Dr. Edward M. Gallaudet found Douglas Craig when he was a young boy wandering the streets of Washington, D.C. Gallaudet discovered that Craig was deaf, and so he brought him to Kendall Green. Craig worked as a handy man at the College until his death. His duty for many years was to carry the mail back and forth from Gallaudet College to the post office. Craig was a very powerful man. We never knew his age. I entered the preparatory class at Gallaudet in 1929. All of the new students were called preps. One night some of the upperclassmen blindfolded us (the preps) and forced us all into a room, one at a time. When my turn came, they led me down the hall and made me stand against the wall. Then suddenly they pulled my blindfold down. I saw in front of me a fierce-looking black man with a knife in his hand. Several upperclassmen were trying to restrain him. The man threatened me and said, "Come here, give me some money." I looked around and asked, "Who are you? What money? And, for what?" The man said that he was Douglas Craig and that I owed him three dollars because he had carried my trunk up to the fourth floor. He said that I had to pay it immediately. "Now? I must pay that money now? Okay, okay." I took three dollars out of my pocket and gave it to him. When I left, Craig called for the next prep, and he repeated the same procedure. He did the same thing to all the preps. I felt sorry for all of us. We were scared to death. The next day I got over the scare. From that point on, for months until springtime, I forgot all about it. Then one day the upperclassmen decided to call all the preps together. They told us that we all had to go camping in Great Falls, Virginia, with them. Many of us said that we had no money left. They started laughing and told us not to worry. They reminded us about last fall when Dougls Craig had threatened us with a knife to collect three dollars. We all had given him the money. Well, the upperclassmen had saved all that money and now they were giving it back to us for our camping fees. Thanksgiving Tug-o-War Donald A. Padden Gallaudet College is rich in tradition. Many traditions that originated in the early years of Gallaudet College have be- come obsolete and have been replaced by new traditions. Few of the old traditions remain in existence today. One of my favorites was the Thanksgiving Tug-o-War. Each year at Gallaudet, new students had to undergo a period of hazing. In order to distinguish them from older students, the new students had to wear buff and blue dink or beanie caps and red ban- dannas in their coat pockets from the opening of the academic year until Thanksgiving. On Thanksgiving Day they were challenged to a tug-o-war by the freshman students. If they succeeded in beating the freshmen two out of three times in the contest, they were free to discard the caps and bandannas. If they failed, they had to continue wearing the caps and bandannas until Christmas. Several upperclassmen served on the Tug-o-War Committee. The committee's responsibility was to select an equal number of par- ticipants from the two classes. The two groups had to weigh the same amount. On Thanksgiving morning, which was usually cold and frosty, the two groups met on the Faculty Row lawn. After tying a red cloth at the middle point of the rope, the committee put the two groups on the opposite sides of the rope. To make the contest more exciting for the fans, the committee borrowed a hose from the neighboring fire department. They used it to spray cold water at the red cloth on the rope. When the committee chairperson gave the go signal, the two opposing groups grunted and groaned and tried to pull each other into the path of the water. The water was really cold. When a person of either group entered the area of cold water, he just lost his strength and became useless to his team. The team who had the most members in the water usually lost. The upperclassmen really tried to make it difficult for the preps to win the match. If the preps won the first trial, the committee would declare a mistrial due to a foul and cancel it. That gave the freshmen another chance to win the match and save their reputation. However, if the preps still won two out of the next three trials, the committee had to award the victory to them. The committee had to release the preps from their cap and bandanna bondage. It is not surprising that over the years that freshman classes won the tug-o-war contests most of the time. College Hall Revisited Francis C. Higgins Gerald Burstein was a student at Gallaudet College back in the 1950s. At that time it was against the rules to have a girl in College Hall because it was the men's dormitory. One day, Gerald's sister came to visit him in his room. In the middle of their visit, they heard a knock on the door. Gerald was frightened. He thought maybe it was a teacher who had come to check on him. He asked his sister to hide in the closet. The closet didn't have a door, only drapes. Gerald put his sister in the closet and closed the drapes. Then he went to the door, opened it, and saw an old man there. The old man said, "I used to live in this room. I'd appreciate it if you would permit me to come in and look around my old room." So Gerald invited him in. The old man looked around slowly and said, "Same old room." Then he walked to the window, looked out for a while, and turned around and said, "Same old view." Just as he was starting to walk away, he noticed a pair of women's shoes sticking out from under the drapes. He smiled and said, "Same old tricks." Gerald became embarrassed and said, "I didn't mean to do anything wrong; she's my sister. We thought you were a faculty member, so I hid my sister in the closet." The old man smiled again and said, "Same old alibi." Do Deaf People Have Ears? Francis C. Higgins When Dr. Edward Miner Gallaudet was president of Gallaudet College, it was customary for the students to meet in Chapel Hall every Sunday evening to listen to his lectures. One night, President Gallaudet introduced a famous visitor to the students. He explained the visitor's background. After the introduction, the visitor stood up and looked over the student body. He had a look of surprise on his face. The visitor turned to Dr. Gallaudet and asked, "Are these people deaf?" Dr. Gallaudet replied, "Yes, they're all deaf; they are students here at Gallaudet College." The visitor said, "But these people have ears!"

Why Hearing Miners Got up Late One Morning Francis C. Higgins Many, many years ago in a small town in Montana, one deaf man worked in a mine. The deaf man had a special way to wake himself up in the morning for work. He threw a rope over a pulley that hung from the ceiling and he tied one end to his alarm clock. When the clock rang, it disconnected the rope, and a heavy old-fashioned iron tied to the other end of the rope would fall onto the floor. Every time that iron fell on the floor it would make a loud noise, and that would wake up the deaf man. The noise also woke up all the other miners in the small town. They became accustomed to using that noise to wake themselves up. One day the deaf miner got married. He and his wife went away for their honeymoon. Three days later, they returned. They were surprised to find the whole town so quiet. All the miners were still sleeping because they hadn't yet heard the iron fall.

A Ghost Story Cheryl Shevlin A deaf couple in Texas wanted to buy a house. They walked around town looking for one to buy. They saw a beautiful house and they looked it over. They both really liked the house, so they wrote down the address and then asked one of their mothers to make a telephone call to the real estate agent. The real estate agent met them at the house. They knocked on the door and met the owner, an older man who seemed to be peevish. After a while, the real estate agent left. The man and woman went into the house. She thought it was a beautiful house. They walked to the kitchen, which was huge, and then to the living room, which was also huge. The fireplace was very nice, and all the rooms had high ceilings. They were curious about the upstairs, so they walked up the steps. There was a black cat sit- ting on the landing. It didn't move, it just sat there. The couple looked around the bedrooms—even those rooms were huge. The bathroom was very long and large. The couple really liked that house. The owner told them to make an offer, so they put down a deposit. Then, they went home and discussed whether they should buy the house. They decided they could afford it. They met with the owner and bought it. Soon, the husband and wife packed and moved into their beautiful house. It didn't need a lot of improvement or work in the backyard. They bought furniture to furnish the house. After a few weeks, they were settled in and enjoying their new house. One night as they were in bed, talking with each other, they noticed the wind outside was blowing up a storm. They felt the house bouncing and rumbling. They grabbed hold of each other until the rumbling stopped. A few weeks later they felt the rumbling and the noise again. That awful vibration! The cat jumped up on the window sill; they were really scared. They looked outside; they knew it was the time of year that Texas tended to have a lot of wind and storms. A month or so later, it happened again. They could feel a vibration along the floor.  It was really frightening. The noise was very odd. They got up and turned on the lights and then felt the wall. It was strange—this wall had become so thin in a certain place that there was an indentation. There was a closet. It was never used. There was tape around the door knob and across the keyhole. The husband and wife thought that was really odd. They didn't remember this closet. They went back to bed. A little bit later the rumbling and the vibra- tions started again. They didn't understand what was happening. They went over to the wall and felt it. Yes, it was the wall that was vibrating. They looked at each other and at the door, trying to decide whether they should open it. Just then, the black cat jumped up on the window sill. That did it, they decided not to open the door. The next morning they called the wife's mother. They asked her to come over and listen to the wall and find out what the noise was. She told them they had very active imaginations. They agreed, but told her the next time they felt that vibration, they would call her. So they waited, until finally the wind howled and the vibration started. They called the mother and she came over. She said she could feel the vibration and hear that strange noise. Then, she felt along the wall. She went downstairs to get a hammer to break open the door. When she got the door open, they were shocked. They could see a skeleton hanging there, bouncing against the wall. A skeleton! 

Oops! Francis C. Higgins Some years ago, a group of teachers at a school for the deaf were sitting in a room, waiting for the teachers' meeting to begin. A few hearing teachers were sitting together and talk- ing. A deaf teacher was sitting in a corner of the room. After a while, the deaf teacher got up, walked over to the hearing teachers, and  asked what they were talking about. One signed to the deaf teacher that they were talking about the Lindbergh kidnapping trial. "What do think about that?" The deaf person thought and said, "Oh, excuse me," and went back to his chair. After a while, he got up and walked back to the hearing teachers and said, "I've been thinking a lot about this. I'm sure there was more than one man involved." The hearing teachers laughed hard about that. The deaf teacher became embarrassed and asked what was wrong. One of them signed to him, "We are talking about the Dionne quintuplets now." 

Poor Beethoven Francis C. Higgins One night, several years ago, two pianists were playing in a hotel in Washington D.C. When they finished playing the Moonlight Sonata, an elderly woman came over and gave them some compliments. She told the two men that they were wonderful pianists and that she really enjoyed their music. She wanted to know who had written that sonata. One of the pianists responded and told her that Beethoven had written it many years ago. He also added it was really wonderful how Beethoven could write many, many different kinds of music, even though he was deaf. The elderly woman said,"What? Deaf—oh I am so sorry." Then she turned and walked away. Several days later, the two pianists received a package with a letter attached. They opened the package and found a hearing aid. When they read the letter, they discovered that it was from the elderly woman. In the letter she asked them to give the hearing aid to poor Beethoven!

Candy or Death Robert G. Sanderson I would like to tell you a true story based on my past experience as a rehabilitation counselor. One day a young man came in to see me. His name was Bill. He sat down and we looked at each other. I really felt sorry for him. He had bumps all over his face—awful red and yellow bumps, pimples and blisters. And that young man didn't feel well either—he felt dizzy and sick. Bill and I talked for a while, and I decided I could help him. I ex- plained to him that the rehabilitation program required several things before I could help. First, I had to send him to a doctor for an examina- tion to make sure he was healthy and to test his nose, mouth, and ears—to see if he was really deaf or not. If he was deaf then I could help him. Bill seemed to understand all this, so I went ahead and sent him to the doctor for a physical. A week or two later Bill came back again. I had received the doc- tor's report, which was very bad. That young man had diabetes, and he needed shots of insulin. I explained to Bill that he must learn how to inject insulin. Bill said,"You mean shoot needles into myself?!" I said, "Oh, it's nothing; you can do it. It's easy." "But I've never done that," he said. "I can't do it, I'm so fright- ened. Put needles in my arm? No. I'm too scared." So I said, "The doctor explained to you that you're sick." "Oh, I didn't understand. He kept talking, but I couldn't read his lips. And when he wrote things down, I couldn't understand it." I brought out the doctor's report. "The doctor says that you have sugar diabetes very badly. If you eat candy, you could become very sick. You could go into shock and you could die!" Bill looked at me and said, "Die? I eat candy all the time and I haven't died." I said, "Maybe not now, but later on if you eat too much candy, it would really hit you and you would faint. If people didn't know what was wrong and just left you there, you would die." Bill looked at me and said, "Really? Really?" "Yes." "Oh, I'm easily tempted. I just love candy!" I said, "Well you must make a choice—your health or your death. You can prevent that death with the insulin. The doctor will show you how to take the medicine; you fill up the needle and inject it in your arm." Bill was frightened. I said, "Well, it's your choice. I want to help you, but you must cooperate." "What am I going to do?" I said, "I'll buy the needle for you and I will get the medicine for you, give you help, show you how to use it, and everything. I will help you do it. You must do it, okay?" Bill was still worried. "I don't want to use a needle," he said. "It's your responsibility. I told you I can't help you if you don't cooperate. Rehabilitation means help. If you die I can't help you. I can't send you to school. I can't get you training for a job if you don't cooperate with me. But if you take the medicine every day, you will be better. Your face is so bad now. Doesn't it bother you when you look in the mirror every morning? You know that it's from the diabetes, from too much sugar. Do you want to look good? Do you want the girls to look at you and like you? Now girls look at you and think your face looks awful and they stay away from you. Am I right, am I right?" "Yes." I said, "Well, okay!" Later on I bought the needle. I went ahead and bought the medicine, too, and called Bill to come back again. I gave everything to him. I explained how to use it, all the different steps, and he promised he would use it. A week passed, then two weeks went by—I was waiting to hear from Bill. I hadn't seen him again and I was wondering if something had happened to him. I went to look for him and found him in his apartment. He was so sick, he couldn't see me. I said, "Did you finish using that medicine?" He said, "No I haven't, yet. I'm afraid." Well, being a counselor I had to help this individual, but how? He was stubborn and afraid. I explained to him, "If you're afraid to take the shots yourself, you'll have to go to the doctor regularly, every morning at the same time. The doctor will give you the shots."  He said, "I don't have the time!" I said, "The time! Then do it youself; it would be easy—you could give yourself the insulin shot and go to work. Do you want to go to the doctor every morning and waste your time?" He said, "No." "Well now, I want to help you, so I'll show you how to boil the needle. You boil it in hot water, take it out, fill it up with the insulin, and you put it in your arm." I showed him how and I let him try it for the first time. He made a mistake, he tried again, and he fainted. Fainted flat on the floor. So, I waited. As soon as he felt better I showed him how to do it again. Still he wouldn't. Then, I noticed his wastebasket—it was full of crumpled candy wrappers. He loved candy! I said "You better stop eating candy. That would help you." He said, "I like it, I love candy." "Okay, I warned you. I have to leave now, but I'll see you later. You come to my office and we'll talk more. I'll explain to you some other things. Now don't you eat candy or you will be sick. Don't eat that candy. Come and see me tomorrow." "Okay." Bill came to see me the next day. I planned a little bit of a surprise for that boy. That morning I went to a mortuary (a funeral home) and asked the funeral director if he would loan me his book of pictures of coffins. I explained to him why and he lent me the book. I brought it to my office. When Bill came in, I said, "Bill, I have something for you." He looked at me with a puzzled expression. I said, "I'll show you." I opened up the book, pointed and said, "These are coffins. I would like for you to pick a beautiful one for yourself. One you would like to be buried in." He was so afraid! He said "No! No!" I said "Yes! Bill, pick the one that you want. Not many people have an opportunity to pick their own coffins. Now you have a chance to look at all the different coffins—before you die! That's wonderful!" Bill said, "No, no, no, no!" His face was white. "What are you afraid of? What's the matter? You can get a nice, soft, white, satin one. Or, maybe you like the red or pink better. You can lay on something comfortable. You can feel how comfortable before you die!" "No, no, no!" He pushed the book away and closed it. "I don't want that, I don't want that, I don't want that!" I said, "Bill, you're going to die soon because your diabetes is very bad. I've tried to help you. If you want to go ahead and keep eating candy, you must be prepared to die. So, pick your coffin now!" Bill said, "No, no, no!" He would say nothing but that—No, no! So, I pushed the book aside. Bill sat with his eyes closed—he was shocked. After a while he looked up at me. "Do you really mean this?" "Yes, I mean this. I'm not teasing you!" "Yes, I see." "You must have the shots!" "Yes, you're right, I must. Okay." So, I helped Bill from there on in. Well, a few years passed by. One day Bill came to see me again. His face was clean; all those bumps were gone. Bill looked pretty good! "How are you?" He said, "Dr. Sanderson, now I have a girlfriend." "Fine, a girlfriend! Plan to get married someday?" "Oh yes!" "That's wonderful. Bill, are you eating candy still?" "No!" And that's the end of my story. 

The First Deaf Postmaster Hubert Anderson, Jr. I think it is important to share experiences with others, so I would like to tell a story about my life. Many years ago I went out in search of a job. One day I had an interview with a man at American University in Washington, D.C. This man told me that he would consider hiring me as a postal clerk and that he would be in touch with me later. I thanked him and left. A few days later the in- terviewer called and asked me to come back. I went in early the next morning. The interviewer told me that he had decided to give me the job. I was very happy about becoming a postal clerk. During my first few months I got to know my co-workers, who were all hearing people. I taught them sign language and they taught me about postal work. I learned a lot from them. I was very motivated and I made many friends. American University had a very large post office; after all, it had almost 14,000 students, and the post office had to serve all of them. It was not very difficult for me to learn the post office system. But communication was a problem in the beginning. Later on, almost all of my co-workers became skilled in sign language. During my fourth year at American University, my boss was pro- moted to another job. It was necessary for him to select someone to take over the job of postmaster. I happened to be in a very good posi- tion for getting that job because of my experience and because I was a good worker; there was no comparison between me and the others. But I happened to be deaf. I had to have an interview for the new job. In the interview my boss asked me if I thought my deafness would be a problem. I told him no, that many other deaf people in the United States had been promoted in their jobs. The important thing was to be given the chance. My boss wasn't worried about my skills, he was worried about the other people. In the end, he decided to give me the position. He an- nounced his decision to all of the postal workers. A few of the workers said, "But, he's deaf, he can't control us." I was really surprised that my co-workers would insult me like that. In the past we had been friends, good friends; I had taught them sign language and we had shared stories about our lives. But on the day the boss picked me to become postmaster, a few of them were really upset. They said I couldn't handle the job. They were very negative. But the boss had made his decision and he stuck by it. On my first day as postmaster I tried my best to make the workers (there were about 60 of them) understand that I would be flexible and fair. Work continued day after day, and most of the time things went smoothly. However, in my first year I had to fire eleven of my workers. They never gave me their full cooperation. Sometimes, they wouldn't even give me phone messages. Very often when a deaf person takes over or becomes the boss, some of the hearing workers object. They may not be used to work- ing with a deaf person, or they may not really understand deafness. But if the deaf person does a good job and is fair, then there won't be any problems. I worked as postmaster for five years. My workers recognized that a deaf person could do a good job. One day a deaf man from Gallaudet College came over to American University to visit me and see my post office. He was very surprised to see a deaf person in control of that big post office, especially with all of those hearing people working under me. I showed him around my post office. He asked me if I would be interested in transferring to Gallaudet College's post office. I told him maybe because there was no place for me to advance at American University. So, he went back to Gallaudet College to arrange a way for me to transfer. A few weeks later I received a letter asking me to come to Gallaudet College for an interview. I remember that interview very well; there were about fifteen people seated around asking me questions. Many of the questions were very easy for me to answer because of my ex- perience in a large post office. Gallaudet had a small post office, so it would be easy for me to manage it. The next day the secretary called me to offer me the job at Gallaudet, and I accepted. Even though Gallaudet had a small post office, I really enjoyed my job—no more of the headaches I had in the big post office. I want young deaf people to know that they can be successful at something, if they try! Don't think negatively about deafness; think positively about achieving success.

An Embarrassing Moment Leon Auerbach In 1943, during the war years, I was working and living in Cam- bridge, Massachusetts. My wife and I lived on the third floor of an apartment building. One night we took a trolley to visit some friends outside of Boston. We played cards and talked and talked late into the night—it was past one o'clock in the morning when we left. It was so late we got the last trolley back to Cambridge. We arrived home and walked up to the third floor of our building. It was then I realized that I had forgotten my keys—I had left them inside my apartment. I was afraid it was not going to be easy to get into the apartment. My wife and I decided to go look for the watchman, but the watchman was off at that late hour; he had already gone home. My wife and I began to wonder how in the world we were going to get into our apartment. I said to my wife, "The police station must have some kind of pass or master key. They could get us in." So, I decided to walk to the police station. I wrote a note explain- ing that my wife and I were locked out of our apartment because I had forgotten my keys. I told the police we had been visiting friends out- side of Boston. The police officer asked why we didn't go back to our friends' apartment. I said we couldn't; all of the trolleys had stopped for the night. There was just no way to get there. The police sergeant said he had to go talk with another police officer. Then the other police officer came back and put on his coat and his hat. I asked him what was going on. He told me to go with him. The police officer and I walked out and got into his car. We rode over to the firehouse. I suddenly thought to myself, the firehouse would have the pass key, it was the logical place, not the police sta- tion. Why should the police station have the key? I should have gone to the firehouse in the first place. When we got to the firehouse, the police officer told me to wait while he went inside. I waited outside. I thought he would be get- ting the keys. All of a sudden, the big doors opened up and the hook and ladder truck (you know the truck with two drivers; one in the back, one in the front) came out. The fire fighters had on their full gear. I thought to myself, oh, my gosh, there must be a big fire somewhere around here. We got back into the car, and the police officer said, "Let's go, you show us the way." I gave him directions to my apartment. All of a sudden, the hook and ladder started flashing its lights and follow- ing us! Boy, I was so embarrassed. When we arrived at the apartment house, the fire truck unhooked the ladder and raised it up to the third floor. By this time all the neighbors were poking their heads out their windows to see what was going on. One of the fire fighters climbed up the ladder and crawled through one of our windows. Then he opened our door from the inside and welcomed us in. All I could say was thank you very much. I never felt so embarrassed. A Close Brush with Death Frances M. Parsons Parti w hen I was twelve years old, my family moved to Tahiti. We took a boat across the Pacific Ocean. Tahiti is a very small island located between South America and  Australia. My family lived there for six years—the first four years were very happy ones. It was paradise. We could swim, canoe, horseback ride—do just about anything. And then World War II broke out. Because Tahiti was controlled by France and France was at war with Germany, we felt the impact of war. You can imagine how much food the French soldiers needed. French ships would land on the island, and the soldiers would go to the Chinese merchants and take their flour for bread. The Chinese merchants were not happy about turning over their flour to the French soldiers. Not at all! They hid their flour for their own businesses. This, however, was not such a good idea because Tahiti is very hot and humid. Bugs and maggots grew in the hidden flour sacks. Whenever we made bread, we had to take out the bugs and maggots before we could eat it! Conditions got worse and worse during the war. Some big ships came and took away many of the Americans who were worried and in a hurry to return to America. My family also wanted to leave Tahiti. We lived forty-five miles from Papeete, the capital city. We packed our things and then drove four hours in a truck to Papeete. On the way, we had to stop to pick up some pigs and chickens for our trip. When we arrived, the boat was already filled with passengers. We felt very frustrated. We had waited one-and-a-half years and we couldn't seem to get out. The situation got worse and worse. There was no food, no paper, no supplies, and no canned goods. We really suffered. A French captain, who was a good friend of ours, asked us if we would be afraid to go on a small sailing schooner. It was only one hun- dred feet across, but we were eager to get on a boat that would take us back to the United States. I was only seventeen years old and I wanted to have a taste of bowling and movies and boyfriends, and I wanted to lead a normal life like other boys and girls. So we went to look at the Potii. When we saw that very, very old boat, we didn't care. The French inspector took a look at the boat and he said we couldn't sail on it because it was too dangerous. We were really upset about that. Luckily, the French captain didn't give up. He found another boat, a cute, small boat that had been converted from a Navy boat. A few Americans, several crew members, and the animals we brought got on the boat. Just before we left, an old Tahitian man came up to us and said, "Please don't go." We asked him why. He warned us that the Matai Rahi was coming. That meant a terrible hurricane was on the way. Well, we had had enough of Tahiti after six years, so we boarded the boat and we said good-bye. As we left the harbor and went sailing out into the sea, the old man cried and cried because he thought he would never see us again. After the tenth day at sea, the hurricane hit. It was a terrible storm—the boat went rocking up and down on the waves. It would go up and then crash down again. The water came flooding over the sides. All day long it worsened. The waves kept hitting against the boat. The boat began to tilt back and forth, and the water began to come in. All of the people remained inside the cabin. The water swished on the floor of the cabin and went up one side and down the other. All the people got together and began to pray. The boat had been rocking back and forth for a while when, all of a sudden, it became quiet. We knew then we had gone underwater, we could feel the water pressure above us. I thought, I'm going to die and I'm only seventeen years old. I asked my mother, "Are we going down?" My mother was very cool. She looked at me and said, "Oh, don't worry. Don't think about it as going down. Water is deep and blue like heaven and the white sands are the same as the white clouds above, the same as heaven. Your hair will become like seaweed and float on the waves. Your teeth will become shiny pearls. Your bones will become coral. Isn't that a pretty way to die?" I accepted that. I couldn't do anything about it. But by a miracle the boat came shooting up out of the water like a cork, and we were saved! Half of our pigs drowned, though. We butchered them and ate them during the rest of the trip. Also, the ocean water got into our water barrels, so we had to drink salty water. Many, many things hap- pened on that trip, but we finally did arrive in the U.S. Part 2 In 1976I planned a trip around the world for one year to spread the message of total communication. I made all the preparations. Before I left, a friend said to me, "You know that guardian angels always watch over children and fools. You be careful." But as I look back, I know I have been a fool! My first stop was in India. After that I went to southern Africa. We were supposed to stop in Mozambique to transfer from one plane to another. As it happened, Mozambique was hit by terrible weather and we were grounded. I stood in the airport wondering, not know- ing, what to do. In Mozambique they really hated white people because of the cruel treatment by the Portuguese in the past. There were big banners across the walls that said "Yankees go home. Imper- ialists go home. White people go home." Carefully, I walked outside with my luggage. A white man came up to me. I admitted to him that I couldn't hear. He wrote a note to me, asking if I were French, German, or British. I told him I was American. He warned me about wearing gold jewelry and about walking alone. I thanked him and took a taxi to a hotel. With four hours to wait until dinner, I rebelled against the man's warning and went outside. The town was dead—not much business or excitement going on. I just strolled around; I felt very safe. On my way back to the hotel I noticed an alley that seemed to be a good shortcut. So I started to walk through it. Suddenly three men between the ages of eighteen and twenty appeared. One of them put his hand over my mouth, grabbed my arms, and pulled me out of sight. (I envisioned my guardian angel's wings finally being too tired to help me. Now I was obviously a fool; my friend had been right.) The man in the middle took my purse, which contained $200. He took my earrings and the bracelets I had bought for my daughters. Then, they pinned me down. I was sure one was about to rape me. I was trembling all over. The man in the middle started to talk to me. The other two had hold of my hands, but somehow I managed to gesture that I was deaf. He gestured back—You can't hear? He gestured to the other men to get away and leave me alone. I wondered what had happened. Then he gestured to me in international sign that he had a deaf sister. He asked me what I was doing. I explained that I was carrying the message of total communication around the world. Well, his deaf sister was oral and she had never been happy. He spared my life so I could continue my work. He even asked if he could help me to my hotel. I told him I preferred going alone, in spite of my tremb- ling. He knelt down and kissed my hand and said that my angel would take care of me. When I reached my hotel room, I wept stormily. I realized that if I had not been deaf, I would have been killed. Or if he had not had a deaf sister, I would have been killed. It's such a big world and that was such a small alley. About a month later, I was in Nigeria. I told my friend the story of what had happened in Mozambique—how terrible it was, what an awful coward I was, and how hard I had cried. He looked at me and said, "You're a coward? Then how did it happen that you stayed here instead of going straight home?" Some People Just Can't Read Leon Auerbach The summer of 1938 was really hot. During that summer I took a trip on a Greyhound bus. I sat next to a middle-aged hearing man. When he started to speak to me, I motioned to him in signs that I couldn't hear. So we just sat there on the bus. We rode on the bus for hours and hours. Then we stopped at a little roadside store. We got out and stretched a bit. Boy! It was hot. The man who had been sitting next to me walked up to me and handed me a Coke. It was ice cold. I thanked him and I gave a little nice sign. That Coke tasted really good. When I had finished it, I went into the store and bought a magazine—a Saturday Evening Post. After a while, everybody got back on the bus. As we rode along I leafed through the magazine. I realized that I had not really thanked the man properly. I wanted to let him know that I really appreciated his kindness. Since I didn't have any paper with me, I decided to use the magazine I had just bought. I wrote on the margin; I can't remember exactly what I said, but it was something like, "Thank you for being very kind, I appreciate the Coke." I gave the magazine to him and I asked him to read the margin. He read it for quite a while. Several minutes passed. Then he smiled at me, folded up the magazine, and put it under his arm. Well, that was the last I saw of my magazine.

Rudi and Me H. Paul Menkis I want to tell you a story about Rudi and me. Rudi is a dog, a Doberman pinscher. Dobermans are black and rust. They are beautiful, big dogs; they're not mean dogs. You can train them for dog shows. How I got Rudi is a long story. A friend knew that I was thinking about getting a dog and so invited me to go to a dog show. At that show I was most fascinated with the Dobermans. They are such a noble kind of dog. I decided I wanted to buy one. I asked some friends how I should go about picking one. They told me to buy from a dog breeder instead of a pet store. I asked them why and they said I would find the best quality dog from the breeder. So I went to see a man who bred pure Dobermans. The breeder showed me a litter; I was fascinated by all the different puppies. The first one that came up to me was cute, but I never really pick the first thing I see. The breeder picked one for me. I wondered how he knew which one to choose, but I trusted him, so I took the puppy. Do you know how much he charged me? You may think it was cheap because it was a long time ago. Well, it wasn't; that puppy cost $350, and that's the truth. I took the puppy home with me. I got a book so I could learn how to take care of it. One of my friends also gave me advice about rais- ing the puppy. I was very excited. This little thing was just a baby and, of course, it was awkward. I wanted to train it, but my friend told me only to house-train it. My friend said I should wait until the puppy was older. When I asked why, my friend said, "Let your dog enjoy its puppyhood. Remember when you were growing up? You had a right to enjoy yourself, and when you became an adult, you became more serious. It's the same kind of thing with a dog." I asked how long I should wait before getting into the serious train- ing. My friend answered, "About eight or nine months. You need to wait until that time. But until then, you just train it not to go to the bathroom in the house and things like that." During those first eight months I signed to Rudi all the time. I never used my voice. I would whistle for him outside, but that was it. As  the time for serious training got closer and closer, I began to notice a funny thing. I think what really happened was instead of my train- ing Rudi, Rudi trained me. That's how things went, anyway. I'll Stick to My Love for Books Kathleen Schreiber I want to tell you about a true experience I had at the Minnesota School for the Deaf when I was thirteen years old. Before I went to that school, I lived in northern Minnesota. This was mostly farm land and there were almost no books or libraries. I loved to read, so when I reached the Minnesota School for the Deaf and saw the big library, I wanted to read all the books. I was excited. My first week there, I took five books back to my dorm room. I started reading, and I read every chance I got. One Saturday my dorm supervisor came into my room and said, "You can't read all the time. You must circulate more, socialize more." I said, "Well, I've finished cleaning my room and I want to read." She just said, "No." I tried to sneak away into the reading room. I figured in that room it would be all right to read. But, again, my supervisor said no. I went to talk with a friend, but I still wanted to read. So I looked for a way to read. One day I was walking home from class and I looked up at our dorm, Tate Hall. There was a big cupola on the top, and I thought if I could get in there, the supervisor would never find me. When I got back to the dorm, I sneaked up to the attic. It was real dark in the at- tic, but when I looked way up, I could see a light. I thought I should try to climb up to the light. I piled up things so I could reach the lad- der. Then I had to climb up to another ladder and open a hatch. The hatch opened into a perfect room. I could see the whole campus from up there. The supervisor would never find me up there. I was really excited. I closed the hatch, went back down the ladder, and sneaked back into my room. The next Saturday morning, and the following four Saturdays, I cleaned my room as usual. Then, I hid some books under my clothes and climbed up the ladder to my secret room. I read until twenty minutes before twelve. Then, I climbed back down and got in line for lunch. On the fifth Saturday morning, I should have suspected that the supervisor was following me around. I had cleaned my room and when I was finished, I sneaked upstairs to the attic. I thought I could read a couple of books in the hours that I had left. When it was twenty before twelve, I opened the hatch. Right away I noticed that the light was on in the attic. Not only that, the superintendent and my super- visor were standing there looking up at me. The superintendent said, "Please be careful." I looked down at them—they looked so small. They were far away. I said, "Don't worry, don't worry." I climbed out and looked around my room; I thought this would be the last time I would see my little room. I got on the ladder, closed the hatch, started climbing down, and then realized that the ladder was on a wooden plank that was very unsturdy and thin. The lad- der was also thin. I had never noticed that before because I hadn't seen it in the light. I continued my climb down, across the plank to the next ladder (which was a bit bigger), and then down a pole. It was a long, long crawl. I had never realized it before because the lights hadn't been on. Finally, I reached the floor. The superintendent asked, "Why were you up there?" I told him, "I want to read, but my supervisor won't allow me to read my books." The superintendent asked, "Why?" My supervisor said, "She reads too much." They looked at me, looked up at the hatch, and then the superintendent said, "You can read in my office from now on." The three of us walked away. Sure enough, after that I always went down to the superintendent's office on Saturday mornings. He made a little reading corner for me with a light and everything. I sat and read every Saturday. I really appreciated that. I finally finished six rows of books in the library, and I never heard one word of criticism about what to read. I hope you all learn to love to read as I did and still do.

Mr. Orman and Susie May Curtis Mr. Orman was one of my teachers at the Kansas School for the Deaf (KSD). He was short and thin, and we always thought he was old. He was born in 1900. My little sister Susie also went to KSD. She would run up and hug me whenever she saw me in the hall. Mr. Orman became really fond of Susie. He would stand in the hall during class changes and wait for her. Susie would run up to him, jump into his arms, and grab him around the waist. She did that almost every day. One September when we had returned to school, we found out that Mr. Orman had moved to the Arkansas School for the Deaf. We did not see him again for many, many years. A few years ago, Mr. Orman came to Gallaudet College for a reunion. When he saw me, he asked how Susie was. I told him she was fine and that she was teaching at the Kansas School for the Deaf. And then I said, "You can't pick up my sister anymore. She is all grown up. Perhaps now she can pick you up!"

The Windows of My Life Mel Carter, Jr. Many deaf students go to schools for the deaf. Most states have one central residential school, and the deaf students from different areas within the state attend that school. I went to the Virginia School for the Deaf. My mother and father went to that same school. I had many of the same teachers and supervisors that my mother and father had. My mother used to tell me many ex- citing stories about going to that school; I was really excited to be able to attend there. When the time came for me to leave for school, my mother and I took the train to Staunton. There was a whole group of deaf boys and girls on the train. It seemed quite a large group from my home area (Hampton) was going to the same school in Staunton. We were all very excited. I was fascinated by all the conversations and sign- ing/talking going on. My excitement for school just elevated. One thing I noticed was that the deaf children's parents who could hear sat together in one area of the train; they never talked to us. But, my mother joined right in with all the young children. She talked and chatted and told us stories. Every time I took the train to school I observed all those things that were going on, but sometimes I would take the time to look out the windows of the train. I'd watch the scenery pass by me. Sometimes I would fall asleep, but most of the time I'd be wide-eyed. Sometimes I would see something really thrilling. The most thrilling sight was the telephone poles. They appeared to zoom past my window. My eyes would become glued to the rhythm of their appearance. I also liked the symmetry of the wires attached to these poles. Sometimes I'd gaze across at the other side of the train and follow the visual music of the wires on the other side. Occasionally some of the telephone poles were down and my eyes would hit the low key on the ground as the train chugged along. The wire patterns were separated, though sometimes they would come together. I'd follow the horizontal swaying of these wires. Whenever my eyes landed on the ground with a grounded telephone pole, I'd talk to the telephone poles saying, "Please don't go down because when you go down, it hurts my eyes." Of all the things about residential school life, I remember the train as being very important in my life and other boys' and girls' lives. Sometimes the boys and girls would come up with the funniest stories. One time one of them came up to me and asked me, "Do you know why the man who is sitting over there continues to give the sign of the cross?" I replied, "No, I wouldn't know why, or understand why, because I'm not Catholic." My friend replied, "Because he thinks the telephone poles look like crosses. As he sees them go by, he blesses himself with the sign of the cross...one blessing for each telephone pole." Then I understood! The windows of the school were very impressive. There were rows and rows of windows in each building. Sometimes girls and boys would stand at their dorm windows and would get each other's atten- tion. Then, little loving things could be said between boy and girl. They would wink at each other and make subtle or shy comments to one another. Through these windows they would tell how much they liked one another. (A long time ago, using the / love you handshape was more private, but now such dialogue is quite open.) Sometimes couples had fights through the windows. One time a boy and girl had a terrible argument through one of these windows. The boy got so mad that he put his hand through the window. It was terrible; his hand bled a lot. Another one of my window memories goes back to when I was five years old. I had a group of friends who were also five years old. There was a group of seven, eight and nine year olds who also stuck together. It seemed that each time we had an important day, or when our groups wanted to go outside and play, it would rain. When it rained, we could not go out. We all had to sit inside or go into a small playroom that was lined with many long windows. When we wanted to tell the rain to stop, we'd get together to try to figure out how to accomplish that. Once, one boy went up to a window and started to bang on it. The other boys and girls started to do the same. Soon all around the room, about sixty students were banging away on the windows. Bang! Bang! Bang! This banging was accompanied by shouts to heaven. We thought maybe if God heard us, we'd get our wish and the rain would go away. We all adopted the window banging technique. Many times we banged on the windows for snow. We always wanted more snow. If there was more snow, we wouldn't have school the next day. One day we finally got God's cooperation. I think it was when I was about four- teen or fifteen years old. It had snowed a little bit, so all of the boys and girls in school decided to try the banging technique. We screamed and yelled to heaven. Heaven seemed to say okay because it continued to snow all evening and all through the night into the morning. In the morning the supervisor came in to wake us. She told us to get ready for school. We couldn't believe that school was not canceled after all. We looked out the window. The snow was extremely high. It measured sixteen inches. We were thrilled. We felt sure that school would be closed. We were so excited. We went to the cafeteria for breakfast hoping that school was canceled. My supervisor was deaf and she couldn't hear the radio, so she didn't really know whether school was canceled or not. She waited until another supervisor gave her the word. When this supervisor notified her that school was closed, we all jumped up and down and yelled for joy. We threw things and chanted, "No school." For the first time, the banging had worked.. .were we thrilled. Yes, we were grateful to those windows. Another important window in my life was at Gallaudet College, which is where I met my wife, Sharon. You know what the two of us did? The two of us would stand by our windows in our dorms, which were located across from each other, and we'd talk to each other endlessly. Later on, of course, we didn't need to communicate through windows. After we became engaged, I took a train to South Dakota to meet Sharon's family. I got on the train and began to look out one of the train windows. I once again gazed at the telephone poles as they went by. I saw once again the wires of the telephone poles. I thought about all the things that had happened in my life. I was twenty years old and I could remember many things from my childhood. I could recollect the funny stories that occurred on the train, even about the man that blessed himself with the sign of the cross. I began to laugh to myself. As the train approached South Dakota, I became excited. I knew it was almost time to see Sharon again. I sat in the train. I had to be patient. I could feel my heart beating. When we pulled into the train station, I looked out the window and saw that Sharon was there. I expected her mother to be there, too, but her mother wasn't there. I spotted a man who I concluded was Sharon's brother. The two of them looked so great just standing there. It was time for me to get off the train. As I walked off the train I could see through the window. I took pity on the brother because he didn't know which person I was. I helped him recognize me by signing as I waved and carried my lug- gage. I got off the train and the first thing I meant to do was hug Sharon. But she pulled away from me and wouldn't let me embrace her. She was timid in front of her brother. She led me over to where her brother was, I shook hands with him and exchanged the "How are you, I am fine." Then we got into the car and drove to their house. I remember I was nervous about meeting Sharon's mother. Inside, my heart was pounding away like crazy. The first thing I noticed was that Sharon's mother could sign and fingerspell. When we met, she signed, "How are you?" I was shocked that she could sign. I signed to Sharon, "I didn't know your mother was so good at signing and fingerspelling." She looked puzzled for a moment, and then she said, "You're right, she can sign and fingerspell." Since Sharon had become accustomed to communicating orally with her mother, she hadn't even realized her mother could sign and fingerspell. Sharon's mother was not skilled, but she did fingerspell most of the time. We could communicate. We had a feast that night. More and more food was brought before us. Most of the food came from the garden. The family wanted to show me where they had grown that food. They pulled me over to the window and I looked out. Behind the garage was a large garden with many, many vegetables growing in it. I envisioned all the things that had gone into making that garden grow. The plowing and sow- ing of the seeds, the cultivating, and the care. Another one of my favorite windows was in my classroom at the Minnesota School for the Deaf. I couldn't believe that I had really become a teacher. I would tell stories, all the stories that I had gotten from the various windows of my life, all the things that were part of my past. I used to have story-reading time in my class. All the students would gather around me. One day we were reading a story that contained the phrase "you are kidding." I thought that maybe those students understood, but I wanted to double check. I called them up to share in the reading of the story. I asked one boy to read that one phrase. The boy began to read and when he got to that phrase, he spelled "You're k-i-d-d-i-n-g." I pointed to him and said, "Your spell- ing is okay, but—k-i-d-d-i-n-g—what does that mean?" The boy replied, "Well, I don't know." I said, "Comeon, come on... give me a sign for that.'' The boy looked at me, his mouth hanging open. He looked at all the students and he looked around. I tried to encourage him by saying again, "Come on, come on, give me a sign for the word." The boy started saying, "Well, well...it means, it means...." I tried to help him. I covered up the i-n-g and just showed him the word kid. He said, "Oh, oh, I know, I know, it means child (signing kid). I said, "Umm huh...kid, well, that's right; well what does the whole word mean?" The boy said, "I don't know." I told him to ask the class. All the students in the class signed that they didn't know either. None of them knew what kidding meant. After a while, one of the boys said, "Oh, maybe it means a father, a big man who grew short and became a kid again." I just about burst into laughter, but I controlled myself. I asked the class, "Is he right?" They all nodded their heads and looked around in agreement saying, "He's right. He's right." At that moment, I closed my book and I looked out the window. I motioned the students to the window and told them to look. I indicated that out on the street there was a big pile of shoes. "Yes," I said, "There are many, many shoes out there." The boys and girls gulped that down and ran up to the window. They looked but didn't see anything. Then they questioned me with "Where, where?" I said, "It's out there, there on the street. Look, look out there." One boy turned around to me and said, "You're lying. Stop fooling." I responded, "Fine." Then I gathered all the children around me again, got them all seated, and said, "I just told you to look out the window. I was fooling; you know the sign for fooling? That's the same as the phrase you're kidding. They all caught on to the idea of what it was—lying, kidding, fooling. It was the same as some other signs they knew, like teasing and other synonyms. They continued to tell me what it meant. All of these windows have been really important to me. They are like my eyes. My eyes are the windows of my life. I have learned many different things through my eyes. I've gotten many different stories through them. I have enjoyed looking out through many windows. Windows have been a significant part of my life.

Rich Girl, Poor Girl Hortense Auerbach The year 1929 was a really big year across the nation. Wall Street crumbled, many banks closed, thousands of people lost their money, and I lost my hearing. At the same time, movies (which had been silent all along) became talkies. I lived in a very small town—McGehee, Arkansas. Approximately three thousand people lived there. When I became ill, the family doc- tor was quite puzzled; he wondered what was wrong with me. No one else in the whole area had that problem. We had no hospital in McGehee, so, finally, the doctor sent some of my blood to a lab in Little Rock. The tests showed that I had spinal meningitis. The doctor acted quickly after he learned the test results. He put a quarantine sign on our house. It was a yellow warning sign that stated no one should enter the house. I had a very contagious disease. All my family had to be innoculated. I was sick for a long time. Finally, I got well. I didn't know how to walk. I didn't know how to move anymore. I had to learn all those things over again, just like a baby. I had to learn to crawl, sit, and walk. I also became deaf. My family didn't know how to communicate with me. They learned how to fingerspell with the English alphabet from the dictionary. And they taught me how. None of us knew anything about schools for the deaf. We had never heard of them. I was the only deaf person in the whole town. For the first year, my parents sent me back to public school, in the same class (the fourth grade), and I wasn't happy, of course. I just sat there and twiddled my thumbs. At recess time the children would make fun of me and stick their fingers in their ears. I became quite sensitive and withdrawn, so my parents took me out of the school. I stayed home and read for almost two years. Then my stepfather heard about a school for the deaf in Little Rock. He went to look at the school. When he came home, my parents decided I should go there. At first my mother was really upset about it. I was the only girl in the family; I had three brothers. My mother couldn't imagine having her only daughter away at school. But, for my future she was willing to do it. She contacted the school for the deaf to find out what I needed. My mother didn't want to take me to school, so my stepfather went with me. We took the train from McGehee all the way to Little Rock. Then we took a streetcar to the school. The buildings were on top of a hill. We grabbed my suitcases and went into the main building. After we had signed all the papers, I was led into the girls' dorm. I was quite nervous. I looked around and saw hordes of children. They were throwing their arms around. I asked my father what those kids were doing and why they all threw their hands around like that. My father quickly put something in my hand and hurried out of the room. All the girls approached me, one-by-one, and asked me what I had in my hand. Well, I opened my hand and saw a ten-dollar bill! They were all amazed! That was a lot of money, and it was mine. I had never had more than five cents before in my whole life. I held the money tightly while the little girls tried to communicate with me. I held it for what seemed to be about an hour. Then the supervisor came in to get me. My stepfather was waiting in another room. He came up to me and said, "Give the money to me." I said, "What?" "Give me the money." So I opened up my hand and he took the ten dollars. He gave me nothing in return. I had been wealthy for a short time, then I was back to being poor. 

Church Experiences Nathie Couthen I grew up in a large family—I have eight sisters and one brother. My parents took us to church regularly. When I was seven and eight, my mother and father didn't like the idea of leaving me at home alone, so they forced me to go to church. They also forced me to join the children's choir. Imagine that! The children stood in rows when it was time to sing. When the con- ductor would raise his hand, I would open my book with everybody else. I looked at the people next to me from the corner of my eye and mouthed the words with them. I opened my mouth to la, la, la when I saw the person on my right la, la, la. When that person turned a page, I turned a page. I would constantly be looking back and forth with my eyes, mouthing the words. When everyone closed their books, I closed mine, too, and we'd all file out and take our seats. I sang in the choir for about four or five years. Then finally, I got fed up and told my mother I didn't want to participate anymore; after all, I could not hear. People knew that I couldn't sing. My lip movements were different from everybody else's. My mother finally agreed. She was willing to let me just sit in the congregation. I was glad about that. I was happy not to be in the choir. I would sit and watch the preacher for a while, and then I would make up different games for myself since I could not understand what the preacher was saying. I would sit quietly and watch the people in the congregation. Soon, though, I became bored. I told my mother that many times. Finally she decided that I wouldn't have to go to church anymore. I could stay home alone. I was relieved! How I Learned about My Deafness H. Paul Menkis How I learned I became deaf is a long story. When I was born, I could hear. I can remember hearing when I was an infant. I can remember especially because there were two noises that really bothered me—the lawnmower and the telephone. Both of those noises always woke me up from my naps. When I was about two, two-and-a-half, I became very ill with polio.  I was lucky that it didn't leave me with any other handicaps. All polio did to me was ruin the nerves connected to my ears. My parents later explained to me that for two weeks I was in a coma. When I became better I was still pretty weak, and I had to go through rehabilitation excercises. After I had recovered, I never really noticed that I couldn't hear anymore. I just forgot all about it. But one thing did strike me as be- ing strange. I'd watch my uncle mowing the lawn. I would watch him and get this strange feeling, you know, that for some reason I just hated this lawnmower. But I couldn't remember why. Sometimes I would look at the telephone and get that same feeling—that I just abhorred that telephone. But I couldn't remember why. I used to think about that quite a lot, the lawnmower and the telephone, but eventually it all faded from my awareness. The strangest thing I noticed was that my parents took turns mov- ing their mouths up and down. I also watched my aunt and uncle do the same thing. So I started to imitate them, you know, just babbling. I didn't have any words or sentences, I just moved my mouth and tried to be involved in whatever they were doing. They would react to me as if they were embarrassed; I don't know if they thought I was cute or stupid or what, but anyway, it all made me wonder. I'd be even more puzzled when they wouldn't be looking at each other but they still knew when to move their mouths. Or else one person would talk and the others would turn and know where to look. One day I tried an experiment. I turned around and waited to see if I knew when and where to turn. I tried several different directions and never did I know what was going on. But they sure knew how to do it, all of their eyes darted to whoever was moving their lips. I experimented with this, too; I moved my mouth and, sure enough, everyone looked at me. I continued to imitate people like this, and finally, I asked my mother and father about this lip movement thing. I knew it had to do with communication but I didn't understand that it came in through the ear. I thought that somehow you listened through the mouth just as you expressed yourself out of the mouth. I asked my parents, "Will I be able to talk like you?" My father answered, "Oh, sure, later on you will be able to talk." So I knew I would be able to talk when I grew up, but I didn't really want to wait. I also asked my aunt and uncle. I saw that I had put them on the spot. They froze for a second and didn't know how to explain it to me. I knew something was up, but basically they told me the same thing— "When you grow up, you will be able to talk." Well, I continued thinking about all this. I noticed that when I went running out the front door, the door would slam behind me and I could hear it. That was one sound I could hear. Also, I was rather naughty with the toilet seat. I liked to pick it up and let it fall; I'd lift it up and whack it down because it made a loud noise that I could hear. But voices, airplanes, and cars, no way; the sound had to be loud and I had to be right next to it. I used to play by slamming the doors and slamming the toilet seat. And then, one day I started to think about those two noises they made, and once again I asked my mother and father about this. Again, they told me the same thing, which they continued telling me until I was seven years old. What happened then was this. One day I was watching someone mow the lawn. It still bothered me, as always, and I asked myself why. I knew I hated it when I was younger. I remembered that. And another thing—the telephone. I remember it used to frighten me so terribly, I hated that, too. I hated the phone and I hated the lawnmower. I just continued to think about it—refusing to give up. Finally it came to me. I remembered how those noises bothered me when I was a baby, how those two noises used to wake me up and frighten me. After I became sick, that stopped happening, but I never put two and two together. This time though, I confronted my mother. "Do you remember, Mom, that before I was sick I was afraid of noises and I hated the telephone? Do you remember where the phone was in the hallway? I remember from when I was two-and-a-half how much I hated the phone and how much it scared me. Whenever I had to go through the hall and pass that telephone, I would walk along, hugging the wall, keeping my eyes on the phone every second until I got safely past it, and then I would scram. I remember that well. And another thing, Mom, I stayed away from that lawnmower. I just kept away from loud noises. "And remember all those times when I asked you about whether I would be able to talk or not? I never connected the fact that the noises from the lawnmower and phone had disappeared with whether I could talk or not. You always told me that when I grew up I would be able to talk. What's going on?" My mother finally realized that it was time to deal with this, so she sat me down and she explained the word deaf. She said to me, "Remember when you were sick, when you were a baby, about two- and-a-half?" "Yes, I can remember. It's pretty amazing how much I can remember from that age." "Well," Mother said, "Yes, you were very, very sick, and that ill- ness destroyed the nerves that led to your ears. You had a horrible fever and your body temperature went way up. I had to pack you in ice and take care of you constantly. But it didn't help; no matter how well we took care of you, it was useless. The fever destroyed the nerves in your ears." "You mean I..." And Mother said, "Well, maybe in the future you will talk." I think my mother, whether consciously or unconsciously, was bas- ing her hopes on hearing aids because at that time researchers were making a lot of progress in hearing aid technology. But really, she should have told me. I wish she had told me that I was deaf. Maybe I could have learned different ways to communicate, and I could have learned things just like anyone else. I remember at that time I became very angry. I felt that a lot of my time—from ages two-and-a-half to seven—had been wasted. All that time I had learned nothing. So please, I want to warn all you people; if you know a child who has become deaf, tell that child right away. Don't pull the wool over anyone's eyes.

A Summer in Los Angeles Don G. Pettingill I became deaf at the age of five. I thought nothing of it because my father was hard of hearing. I had eight brothers and sisters. Whenever I felt sorry for myself and quarreled with them, my sisters and brothers would say "Your deafness is nothing, you're just like your father." My mother, just like all mothers, felt bad about my deafness. She especially felt bad saying, "My son is deaf." She was always look- ing for a way for me to regain my hearing. Once my mother took me to an Indian reservation to see an Indian medicine man. All the In- dians gathered around while the medicine man put snake oil on my ears. They started jumping around and hollering and carrying on. I understood nothing, and my hearing did not improve at all. Another time Mother took me to a chiropractor who twisted me around and jerked my neck. For one year I went to that chiropractor, and I really suffered from his ministrations. But, I didn't regain my hearing. As a last resort, my mother sent me to my aunt and uncle who lived in Los Angeles, California. They had joined a big church. They had told my mother, "If Don came to Los Angeles we would pray in the church. Then, Don would hear again." My mother must have believed them because I went to Los Angeles to stay with my aunt and uncle. The first Sunday morning I was there, we went to church. I was really impressed with the size of the congregation. I sat and twiddled my thumbs during the service. I couldn't understand anything. The next morning my aunt took me to the church and dropped me off. I went into a room filled with people. I was the only young boy there. I couldn't understand what was going on. All at once a man near me jumped up and started wriggling around on the floor. I stared at him, and I started to get scared. I elbowed the man next to me and asked, "What's the matter with him?" He chuckled and told me that the fellow was filled with the Holy Spirit. I thought, "Wow, it must hurt!" The next morning, Tuesday, my aunt dropped me off at church again. I started to open the door, but I couldn't make myself go inside—I was too scared. Instead, I decided to explore Los Angeles. Every morning for two weeks, my aunt would drop me off at that church, and every day I would wander around the city of Los Angeles until it was time to go home. If my aunt suspected anything, she never let on. There were so many things to see in Los Angeles. One day I noticed a junk dealer in a horse-drawn wagon going through the alleys. He was picking up junk from trash cans. I asked someone what he did with all that junk and was told that he sold it. I thought that would be a good way for me to make money, so I started going through the alleys; foraging through the trash cans; and collecting bottles, wire, and old clothing. When the junk dealer came by the next time, I sold everything to him. He gave me one hundred pennies. This really ex- cited me; money of my own! I began working extra hard collecting old newspapers and anything else I could. Soon I had enough money to buy a little red wagon. This enabled me to collect more junk, which meant more money. I was proud of my little business. I started going farther and farther away from home, looking for more riches in the alleys. I would be exhausted when I finally got home. Sometimes when I came to a steep hill, I would get in my wagon and coast all the way down, getting a little rest on the way. But it was wild! Sometimes the wagon would go so fast I would pray that I wouldn't get hit by a car as I shot across an intersection. Fortunately I never got hit, but there were many near-misses. However, my fear of getting hit didn't stop me from coasting down hills whenever I could. I really learned a lot of things that summer in Los Angeles. I learned how to be honest and straight with people. And I learned how to ask. One of my friends taught me how to sneak into a rich woman's yard and steal figs from her tree. I liked figs, so every chance I could, I would go in and get some figs and eat them. Well, one day while I was picking some figs from the tree, someone grabbed me and turned me around. It was the rich woman. She had a stern expression. She asked me why I was stealing her figs. I understood what she said but pretended I couldn't. I told her I was deaf. She was taken aback, and said, "Why, you poor little boy!" She started patting me on the back and being nice, then she asked kindly why I was stealing her figs. This time I answered her—"Well, I'm hungry." She replied, "You don't have to steal; why don't you just ask?" I said, "Oh, if I had asked, would you have given me the figs?" She said, "Of course! I have lots of figs; there's no need for you to steal." So I learned how important it was to be honest and to ask. I learned something about people during my stay in Los Angeles. I would spend all day wandering around with my little red wagon. Sometimes I would get lost, and then I would need to ask for help. I always carried a little card in my pocket that had my address. Some people were really nice and would try to help by giving me directions, which I didn't always understand. Others would go out of their way to drive me home. Still others would try giving me directions, but when I could not understand them after several attempts, they would get frustrated and tell me to go away. There were so many different types of people. I learned how not to be afraid; if I got lost I could always find help from someone. I also learned about bullies. I learned not to let them frighten or threaten me. On one of my trips with my little red wagon, a gang of boys started following me around. They screamed insults at me. I knew what they were doing from the expressions on their faces. They were especially mean because I couldn't hear. One day they all gathered around me in a circle so that I couldn't get away. I was scared, but I just stood there, not moving. They started taunting me and I just stood my ground, looking at them and trying not to show my fear. I was not sure what I should do. There was one boy right in front of me, and I knew he was the leader. I stared right into his eyes, let out a wild yell, and ran at him. I punched him in the nose and knocked him down. I could see he was scared, and I knew I had won the respect of the other boys. They decided then that I should be their leader. Can you imagine that, a deaf kid leading a bunch of hearing kids? That group became my first sign language class. I taught them many signs. This was also my first deaf awareness class. I ex- plained all about deafness—the frustrations and everything. Two of those gang members are still good friends of mine. Oh, it was a very interesting summer. I also learned about hypocrites. At the end of the summer the church had a big revival. Most of the church staff knew that I didn't attend church at all after the first two days, but the officials saw a chance to prove that their church could work miracles. I was coached to go up on the stage and shout into the microphone, "Praise the Lord, I can hear better than I did!" I knew that wasn't true, but I couldn't resist the temptation to be the center of attention. There must have been five thousand people watching me, and I still remember how the church erupted. People started screaming, crying, and carrying on. Several women of the church kept coming up and hugging me and crying, and I almost got smothered in their ample bosoms. I do believe my simple declaration helped raise $100,000 for the church that day. That's hypocrisy for you. There must be a moral to this story. I think it could be best described as, "Keep an open mind and dare to be different!" 

Spelling May Curtis My mathematics teacher at the Kansas School for the Deaf was Edward Foltz. He had graduated from Gallaudet in 1915. One day he went to the drugstore. When the manager saw Foltz, he got his attention because he needed help. One of the boys from KSD was in the store. The boy had written a note that said, "I want Sunday." The manager didn't know what he meant. Foltz thought for a while, and then said, "Oh, he means he came here for some ice cream. He means sundae." Foltz knew that many of the students at KSD were terrible spellers. So from then on, he decided to do something about it. He would look around at the boys and girls talking to each other and would ask them what the word was for different signs. For example, if they signed crazy stomach, he would ask what the word for that was. Sometimes he would give them a word and they would have to show him the sign. Whenever we had five or ten minutes left before the end of class, Foltz would bang on the table to get our attention. He would say, "We are going to have a spelling list—ten words. Number your papers one to ten." Then he would say, "I want you to spell out the word for gym." "We know gym, g-y-m." "No, you have to spell out the entire word on paper. Next, think of another word for the sign exercise—not the word exercise itself, but something that starts with a c." "C? Oh, calisthenics," we answered. We would go through several signs and words like these. One word I especially liked was for the sign with arms on the hips. It is akimbo. Some girls and boys did not like this kind of spelling class, but I found that it taught us to spell correctly. Now I wonder why schools for the deaf don't have spelling bees. I think it is a good idea. Do you? My Experiences in School Carolyn McCaskill I grew up in Mobile, Alabama. I attended a public high school. At that time, 1963, there were no interpreters in my school. I became very, very frustrated. I depended on my hearing friends for in- formation about what was going on in class. School became so frustrating that one day I just gave up. I told my mother I didn't want to go to that school anymore. I wanted to transfer to the Alabama School for the Deaf. My mother finally gave in, and my sister (who's also deaf) and I transferred to the Alabama School for the Deaf. My sister and I felt a little awkward at our new school. We didn't know any sign language and there were no sign language classes at the school. We had to pick up signing by associating with the deaf students. The Alabama School for the Deaf was a segregated school. It was only for black deaf children. The students' educational values were very, very low. My sister and I really never had to study because we had very good backgrounds from the public schools, even though we had missed a lot of information in school. I did not have any role models. I never had heard of a successful black deaf person. I did not know any black deaf teachers, or prin- cipals, or successful business people. Most of the black deaf people who graduated from the Alabama School for the Deaf went to work in factories or laundries, or they became custodians or janitors. I realized that I did not want that to happen to me. Fortunately, the Alabama School for the Deaf was forced to in- tegrate in 1968. Integration of black and white students was a whole new experience. Educational values became very high. I learned so much; it was like being in a different world. I learned about Gallaudet College. Before, I had never even heard of Gallaudet College. I remember asking some deaf white teachers if blacks could enter Gallaudet. The teachers said of course. I asked one teacher to show me the Tower Clock (the Gallaudet yearbook). My jaw fell when I saw pictures of African students. My teacher assured me I could get into Gallaudet. I said, "Me? No way! I'm too dumb." I just thought that all black deaf students were dumb. The teacher said, "No; you can do it. You just have to study hard." I asked her how I could improve my English. She said, "By reading." I said, "Reading? I don't like that; it would be really boring." "That's the only way you're going to improve yourself," she replied. So, I read and I read. When my teacher asked me what I wanted to become in the future, I told her a teacher or a counselor. I wanted to help other deaf children. My teacher encouraged me. I had several good white deaf role models. My teachers encouraged me to study hard. They said if I studied hard I would pass the Gallaudet exam. My goal became to study hard. I passed the Gallaudet Entrance Exam and so did my sister. We both went to Gallaudet. Being at Gallaudet was an eye-opening ex- perience. I met African students, Chinese students, and Russian and German students. I was so happy my first year at Gallaudet. I wrote home often to describe to my mother my different experiences at Gallaudet. I really enjoyed my years at Gallaudet. My best year was 1976—that's when I became Miss Gallaudet. I really felt that was the biggest achievement of my life at Gallaudet. My sister and I both completed all five years at Gallaudet, and we graduated in 1977. By that time, I had decided to enter the graduate school; I wanted to become a counselor rather than a teacher. I at- tended the graduate school for two years, and I graduated in 1979. Then I applied for work at the Model Secondary School for the Deaf (MSSD). I worked there for two years as a dorm counselor. And then in the fall of 1981I became a school counselor at MSSD. I feel that I have accomplished a lot. But I'm still not finished with my goals. Every time I've succeeded in attaining one goal, I set another one. My next goal is to get my Ph.D. someday. I believe that you can succeed if you set your mind to it; then you can indeed attain your goals. 

Born Deaf and Free Frances M. Parsons During the year 1976, I traveled around the world to fight against oralism and to explain the value of total communication. I visited many countries. When I look back now, I wonder if it was worth all my time, effort, strength, and health; and I wonder if I accomplished my work. Many countries indicated that they appreciated gaining an understanding of the meaning and value of total communication. While I was in Nigeria, I stayed in the home of Gabriel Adepoju. Adepoju is deaf, and he is the principal of a school. One night we had a long talk. He asked me if I was writing a story about my travel experiences. I told him I was writing a diary and that I sent it to Gallaudet every month. I also said that maybe someday I would write a book. He told me that I should write something very strong that had a lot of impact. "Many people can't read a book, but something very short and strong will have more impact," he said. That night I went to bed at about midnight. I felt restless. At about one o'clock in the morning I woke up. I had a lot of ideas in my head. I got a pencil and some paper and started writing. Before I knew it, it was five o'clock in the morning. I looked at what I had done, then I put it aside, turned the lights off, and went to sleep. The next morning I looked at the poem I had written. I decided to call it "Born Deaf and Free.'' It is a long poem. The first part of it goes like this: Born Deaf and Free Bells! Bells! Bells! Bells! Who can hear the bells? The Hearing The Hard of Hearing The Partially Hearing I am deaf, congenitally and profoundly deaf. Born deaf, stubborn and free. I was born to a hearing mother and a hearing father but they granted me the greatest gift ever bestowed—Love, Pride and Independence. I was their beautiful mistake. Happiness came first. Education came next. Speech came last. My mother and father could hear and they heard the pleas of the deaf. Bells! Bells! Bells! Bells! They gave me a bell of confidence a bell of happiness a bell of harmony a bell of hope Through heavenly communication of godgiven and godsent dancing hands and prancing fingers. Bells! Bells! Bells! Bells! Who can hear the Bells? So far, my poem has been translated into eight different languages.
