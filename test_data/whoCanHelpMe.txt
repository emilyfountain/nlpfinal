Who can help me? : a building blocks picture book for three-year-olds
Near a winding country road, there is a white wooden house with bright red shutters. This is where Matthew Manning --known as M&M -- lives with his One dog, two Cats, three gerbils and four bunny rabbits. His sisters and dad live here, too.
M&M is a big boy. He can wash his face and hands, go to the potty, feed his pets and have fun playing all by himself.
But M&M worries that there are some things he can't do all by himself. This makes him frown.
"What's wrong, M&M?‚Äù asks his dad. "I am worried," says M&M, "about who can help me do the things I can't do by myself?"
"What things are worrying you?" asks his dad. "I know that when I start going to day care, you will take me there," says M&M. "But how will I get home?"
"That's a good question," says M&M's dad. "Let's name all the people who can help you." "You can," says M&M. "That's right," says dad. "And Bobby Tucker's mom can take you and Bobby home. When Grandma Manning comes to visit, she can take you home, too. But no one else is allowed to take you home."
Who are the people who can help M&M get home from day care? There's M&M's Dad, Bobby Tucker's Mom, Grandma Manning.

"What if I get sick?" says M&M. "Who can give me medicine?" "Another good question," says M&M's dad. "Let's name those people." "You can," says M&M. "That's right. When you get sick at home, I can give you medicine," says M&M's dad. "And Of Course, Dr. Frankel can too, at her office."
"But what if I get sick at day care?" asks M&M. "Well," says M&M's dad, "your teacher, Mr. Jenkins, can help. But remember, no one else is allowed to give you medicine."

"What if I need to go somewhere?" asks M&M. "Who can drive me?"
"This is very important," says M&M's dad. "I can drive you places. So can Mrs. Tucker and Grandma Manning. But unless I tell you it's OK, never, ever get into a car with anyone else."
