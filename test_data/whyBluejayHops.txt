Why bluejay hops : a Skokomish legend
Long ago at a big meeting, Raven boasted about his arrow shooting. He was the best shot in the world. This is what he told everyone.
Skatefish came along. He made himself as big as he could. Dancing, he teased Raven's marksmanship. He gave Raven three chances to hit him.
Whizz! Raven's arrow shot forth. Laughing, Skatefish turned sideways.
Teasing Raven, Skatefish spread himself out again. Whizz! Another miss, another laugh.
Once more again! Raven missed three times!
Then Bluejay stepped forth. “I can do that too,” he said. “I’ll give you three chances.”
Bluejay planned to copy Skatefish. He spread himself out like Skatefish and teased Raven.
Whizz! Raven's arrow shot forth. Bluejay turned sideways. Ping! Right in the hip! “Ow!” screamed Bluejay. He forgot he wasn't skinny like Skatefish. And ever since, because of his vanity, Bluejay hops.
