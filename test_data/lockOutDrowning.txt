Minnie Mermaid teaches Sam to lock out drowning
Learn how to swim.
Swim only when there is a lifeguard or an adult to watch.
Swim with friends not alone.
Stay out of water during stormy weather.
Play safely around the pool.
Fences around swimming pools protect children from drowning. Keep your pool gate locked.
Wait awhile before going into the water after eating.
Jump feet first to test the water before diving.
Wear your PFD (Personal Flotation Device) if you cannot swim.
Play safely when at the lake. Be alert for sudden wind gusts.
