Denton's Detectives A Building Blocks Picture Book for Five-Year-Olds
Mrs. Denton calls the children in her family day care home the best problem solvers in Springfield. Dawne, David, Shantay, Vic and Elizabeth can solve anything.
When the bird feeders emptied all at once, the children discovered the squirrels were eating the seeds. When Mrs. Denton lost an earring, it was the children's idea to search the sandbox. When the wind blew over their block tower, the children figured out that a storm was coming. Now, they call themselves Denton's Detectives.
One day, Mrs. Denton told the children about a new project. "We all love carrots for snacktime," she said as she gave the children packets of carrot seeds. "Let's grow our own." The children thought that was a great idea. "But how will we know what to do?" asked Dawne. "We've never grown carrots before."
David had an idea. "Let's go to the grocery store," he said. "I bet Mr. O'Brien, the vegetable man, can help us." But Mr. O'Brien couldn't help. "I know how to choose tasty carrots for my customers to eat," he said, "but I don't know anything about growing them."
Then Elizabeth had an idea. "Maybe a book is what we need," she said. "Let's ask Mrs. Cushing, the librarian." Mrs. Cushing found a book about vegetables, but it didn't show how to grow carrots. "What now?" the children wondered.
"Why don't we ask our neighbor, Mr. Miller?" said Shantay. "He can grow anything!" Mr. Miller was happy to share his gardening hints with the children. "Carrots need just enough light and just enough water," he said. "Not too much, not too little. That's all it takes to have a fine carrot crop."
Denton’s Detectives now had a new problem to solve. How much light and how much water were just enough? They decided to try an experiment. They planted some of the seeds in Mrs. Denton's backyard.
They planted some of the seeds in the windowbox.
They made a plan for watering the seeds. They watered some of the backyard seeds once a day and some twice a day. They watered some of the windowbox seeds once a day and some twice a day. Then Denton's Detectives watched to see what happened.
Soon the seeds began to sprout. All the windowbox plants looked pale and small and some of the backyard plants were droopy. Only the backyard plants that were watered once a day were green and strong. "Congratulations!" said Mrs. Denton. "Your good detective work has solved the problem of how much light and water we need to grow healthy carrots.
The children planted the rest of the carrot seeds in the backyard and took turns watering them once a day. Before long, the backyard was filled with carrot plants. "There must be hundreds," said Shantay. "More like millions," said Vic. "No, zillions!" said Dawne. "What will we do with them all?"
"Well," said Mrs. Denton, "we can put them in soup, mix them in muffins, and chop them up for salads." "But we'll still have lots of carrots left," said Elizabeth. "How can we use them up?"
We can tie-dye T-shirts with carrot juice," said Mrs. Denton. "...and string carrot slices together for necklaces," said Shantay. "...and cut carrots into shapes and print designs, just like we do with potatoes," added Vic. "Then we can have a carrot carnival for our families and friends," said Mrs. Denton.
One day, when the children were playing in the backyard, Dawne made a discovery. Some of the carrot plants were bent over. Some had missing tops. And some had completely disappeared. What was going on? This was another job for Denton's Detectives.
For days, the children watched the garden for clues. One afternoon, David spotted two rabbits nibbling at the carrots. "Come look," he called quietly.
"What should we do?" whispered Dawne. "We need carrots for the carnival, but we don't want the rabbits to go hungry."
“Hmmmmmm," said Vic, How about this?
Denton's Detectives had solved another problem. "Good work," said Mrs. Denton to the children. "Now the carrot carnival can begin!"
