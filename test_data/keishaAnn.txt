Keisha Ann, that's who I am : a building blocks picture book for three-year-olds
Hi, hello. How do you do? I'd like to introduce myself to you.
Mommy calls me "big girl." Daddy calls me "sugar bun." But neither is my real name. They call me that for fun.
What's my name you wonder? I'll tell you right away. It's Keisha Ann Montgomery, the "queen of Sycamore Way."
Welcome to my home At 15 Sycamore Way. It's where I sleep at night and play throughout the day.
I live here with my mommy, Daddy and brother Joe. Over On the next street lives my Granny Flo.
Come look into my bedroom and see my favorite toys. Sometimes I play here quietly. Sometimes I make noise.
I love to look at story books and do puzzles every day. I build towers out of blocks and make dinosaurs of clay.
It's great to be three years old I'm not a baby anymore. I get dressed with no one's help and hang my nightie on the door.
The bathroom is a private place where I brush my teeth with care. I wash my face and dry my hands then help Mommy braid my hair.
This is my family's kitchen, where I eat meals every day. I help by setting the table and clearing plates away.
Granny told me this morning, since I'm as grown up as I am, she will show me how to make oatmeal, toast and ham.
This is my Special place for Fuzzy Cat and me. Mommy takes us here. Where there's lots to do and see.
And here we can be ourselves and dance and sing and play, And dream of happy times ahead For the "queen of Sycamore Way."
I've had such fun talking About myself and what I do. But now it's time to listen And hear all about you.
Who are you? Can you tell me: your name? About your home? About your room? About your bathroom? About your kitchen? About your special place? Your Friend, Keisha Ann (That's who I am.)
