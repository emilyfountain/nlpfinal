How the Big Dipper and North Star came to be : an Assiniboine story
Long ago monsters roamed the earth and hunted for people to eat. At that time there lived seven brothers. These brothers lived in a big tepee far in the forest near a lake. The brothers shared many things, even cooking and hunting chores. Whenever the brothers went hunting, one or two remained at home to take care of the tepee and do the cooking.
One day while the youngest brother was out hunting, he got a buffaloberry thorn caught in his hand. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't get the thorn out. Soon his hand began to swell and hurt. The following morning, the youngest brother stayed home while the rest of the brothers went hunting. His hand still hurt, so he decided to wash it and see if the thorn would come loose. While he was washing his hand a little girl popped out instead of the thorn. He was so surprised! He took the little girl and put her under his pillow. When his brothers returned, he didn't tell them what had happened. Finally, the oldest brother asked about his hand. He told everyone what had happened.
Everyone wanted to see the little girl. The youngest brother carefully took the little girl from behind his pillow and showed his brothers what she looked like. After seeing the little girl the oldest brother said, “We will keep her and raise her like our own daughter.” When the little girl began to walk, the oldest brother gave her a beaver for a pet. Soon twelve moons had passed and the girl had grown into a teenager.
During the next six moons the girl learned many things. Before long the girl knew how to tan hides and make clothes. She even made a bigger tepee for her seven fathers. One day the oldest brother told the girl to always be careful because monsters roamed about looking for people to eat. "The monsters try to fool people by telling them that they are cold and hungry. If you hear monsters you must not open the tepee flap, even if you feel sorry for them,” the oldest brother told the girl. The girl stayed inside the tepee and continued to do her chores while the brothers went hunting. The beaver stayed with the girl and kept her company.
One day while the girl was alone, she heard a voice outside saying, “I’m cold and hungry.” The girl heard footsteps walking around the tepee. Thinking there was a real person outside, she opened the tepee to take a peek. It was a monster! The monster grabbed her by the wrist and pulled her outside. “Come on,” the monster said, “I’m taking you home with me.” The girl told the monster to wait so she could bring her beaver. The monster yelled, “Hurry and get it. We have a long way to go.” The monster took the girl to the lake where he had his boat. He pushed the girl and her beaver into the boat. The monster took a stick and hit the boat! A saying, "All right boat, let's get going.” Soon the boat was moving across the lake. After awhile the monster again hit the boat and this time he told the boat to go faster. The boat went as fast as it could.
It was sundown when they arrived at the monster's house. The monster told the girl to get out of the boat and go inside. The monster hollered to his grandmother, "Come see what I brought home.” When the monster's grandmother came out, the monster said, "Look what I brought for us to eat. She is a little on the skinny side. We will keep her and fatten her up first.” The monster told his grandmother to keep an eye on the girl so she would not run away.
“I will sleep outside.” He made his bed by the door in case the girl tried to sneak away. She would wake him up if she tried to jump over him. During the next week the monster went hunting for other people even though he still kept the girl captive. Everytime the monster returned, he was always empty handed. Finally, one day as the monster was leaving to go hunting, he told the grandmother, “Kill the girl. She is fat enough. We will have her for supper.”
After the monster left the grandmother told the girl, “You must kill me and cook me instead. When you cook me save my arm. Take a hatchet and put my arm far in the forest. Then you must leave as quickly as possible. Run towards the morning sun and you will come to a creek. You must cross the creek and run along the edge of the forest. Soon you will come to a house which looks like a tepee, but this house will be as hard as stone. Knock on the door and someone will help you.”
The girl put the old lady in the pot and began to cook her. She put a lot of wood in the fire so the pot would boil. Taking the old lady's arm, hatchet and her pet beaver, she headed for the woods. When she was far away, she put a hatchet in the arm's hand and left it under a tree.
The girl ran through the woods as fast as she could. She ran in the direction the old lady had told her. Soon she came to the creek but could not cross it because the banks were too steep. The girl didn't know what to do. 
Once the girl crossed the creek, the beaver followed her. When they reached the forest, they ran along the edge. She didn't know how far they would have to run. They kept on going as fast as they could. When the monster returned home, he hollered to his grand- mother, “I’m home. Where is my dinner?” The monster saw the pot of stew boiling on the fire and decided to start eating. Again the monster called to his grandmother but still she did not answer.
As the monster ate he heard chopping sounds coming from the woods. The monster thought his grandmother was out chopping more wood for the fire. The monster called for her to come and eat, but the chopping sounds continued. After the monster tasted the stew he said, "This stew smells and tastes like an old lady.” The monster decided to go look for his grandmother. He began walking toward the chopping noise. When he reached the tree where the girl had left the arm and hatchet, he saw his grandmother's arm. The monster knew the girl had run away. “I will follow her because I can smell her scent,” the monster shouted.
About this time the girl had finally reached the big tepee house which was as hard as stone. She knocked on the door and asked for help. Just as the door was being opened, the girl heard the monster coming from the woods. “Please - - hurry! There is a monster after me,” the girl cried. When the door opened the man inside the house saw the monster too, but the monster reached the girl. “Let the girl go!” the monster shouted to the man. “She’s mine!”
The man went inside and came out with two large mountain lions. He let the lions go and they attacked the monster. The man , t took the girl inside and told her the mountain lions were his pets. He also told her she would be all right now that the monster was gone. After the girl had stayed with the man for many months, he told her, "You have been away from home for a long time. Your seven fathers still miss you. They think you are dead. I think it is time for you to return home.” The man had magic powers and he could turn himself into an eagle. “I will take you home. While you walk, I will fly over head and guide you.
The next day, the man changed into an eagle. He stayed with the girl until they arrived at her home. When the eagle knew the girl was safe, he flew back to his home and changed back into a man.
The girl peeked inside the tepee and saw her seven fathers sitting with their heads bowed. She pushed her beaver inside the tepee. When the brothers saw the beaver they shouted and were happy. They welcomed their daughter and gave thanks that she was safe.
The next morning the oldest of the brothers said, “My daughter, we must protect you from the monsters which roam the earth. To do this we will go up to the sky. From this day on we will be the Big Dipper and you will be the North Star. Whenever people look into the sky at night, they will see you and they will not get lost.” Together the brothers and the girl flew to the sky. There they stayed, safe from all the monsters on earth.
