Jess and Jamie get the mail : The ready, set, go! adventure book 
Jamie is getting ready to get the mail. Her Dad ties her shoes — in double knots. "Have a good walk, but come right back!" he says.
Next door, Grandma gets Jess ready, too "Don't run on the stairs. Take your time."
Ready to go? asks Jess. Sure! says Jamie. Time to get the mail."
Jess and Jamie try to push open the door to the stairs "The door is too heavy!" Mr. Henry helps. "Thank you, Mr. Henry!”
On the stairwell, Jamie shouts "Look out! There's a cat!"
Good thing you have sharp eyes. I almost fell!"
Suddenly, the pipes bang, clang, and rattle! "I'm scared!" Jamie says.
"Don't worry," explains Jess. "My Grandpa told me a story about how the pipes make a lot of noise when the heat comes on. They used to scare him when he was little.”
Darkness! The lights in the stairway go out! Jamie has an idea. "Don't worry. My Dad gave me this flashlight." 
In the hall, Jess and Jamie hear a strange voice. "Have a cookie?"
“No, thanks,” says Jess. “Not me," says Jamie. 
A bird lands outside on the fire escape. "Look how pretty it is!" says Jamie. "Let's go see it!" says Jess.
"I don't think so," Jamie answers. "My Dad said I should only go out on the fire escape when there is a fire.”
On the stairs, Jess and Jamie see a scary shadow. “What's that?" asks Jess.
“I don't know," answers Jamie. “Let's go the other way."
Finally, they get to the mailboxes. Then Jamie looks for her mailbox key...
But the key falls out of the pack into a hole in the floor. So does Jamie's favorite marble! Jamie uses a stick to get the key.
“Did you have any trouble?”
Jess and Jamie both finish their jobs, and come back home. Grandma and Dad are happy to see them.
Many things happened! Jess and Jamie each tell all about their adventures. Can you remember what happened?
