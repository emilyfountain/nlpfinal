Mary Queequeesue's love story
Mary Queequeesue was telling on herself about when she was still a young woman. Mary said, "I got me a husband, a young husband. I was just starting to really like him and was getting used to having him around when another woman ran off with him. He got himself a younger wife. They were married by a priest and I started crying around.”
When the Indians moved to the prairies for their summer hunting, Mary went with them. They reached the plains and Mary was still crying around. Early one morning an old woman came into her tepee and sat down. "I am going to tell you something,” she said. “Go ahead and tell me,” Mary replied. "You are very lonely for your husband because he ran off and got a younger wife. You have been lonely and crying around.” "Yes, I have been,” Mary answered.
The old woman said, "I wasn't thinking about you but last night when I went to sleep, I had a dream. Some- one pointed and said, ‘Look at her. She is lonely.' I looked and saw it was you. You were sitting there crying. Then I saw your husband with that other woman.” "Yes,” Mary said, "all of that is true.” Then the old woman told her, "I have medicine for what I’ve been telling you. You will have to pay a high price if you want my medicine. Pay me with some good things and I will fix it so you will get your man back. I cannot do it for nothing. I want to be happy too. You will be happy and I will be happy with the things you give me.”
Mary told her mother about the old woman. Her mother offered to help her by giving her a woman's dress. It was a really nice dress, a buckskin blanket, moccasins and other nice things that Mary laid before the old woman. "You already know what the horses look like,” she told the old woman. "When my man comes back, I am going to give you the horses. You can take all these other things now. Will all of this make you happy? Is it enough?”
The old woman looked the things over and said, "These things are good. They make me happy. Thank you. Thank you. Now we can make your man come back.” "Early tomorrow morning,” the old woman told Mary, "I'll come get you and we will go down to the water so you can bathe. But today fix two little dolls. Make one doll a man and the other a woman. Fix a buckskin dress for the woman. Make a little boat out of tree bark. Tomorrow morning we will go down to the water and fix it. I'll have my medicine with me.”
Early the next morning before the sun came up the old woman asked Mary if she was ready. Mary said, "Yes.” "Okay, let's go,” the old woman told Mary. They went down to the water. When they got there the old woman said, "Take off your clothes. We are going to bathe.” When they finished, the old woman told Mary, “Go get the little dolls and the boat you made.” Mary went after them and walked back into the water up to her knees. "Now put the two dolls on the boat. That man doll is your husband and the woman doll is the woman he ran off with. This is my medicine. Take the male doll back and let the woman in the boat go.”
Mary let go and the woman doll floated down the stream. "My medicine will reach your husband today,” the old woman said. "My medicine is strong. Four days from today your husband will be back.” They were a long way from Mary's husband and the other woman. "He will try together in four days,” the old woman said. "If he doesn't get back to you in four days he will die. There is nothing we can do if he doesn't make it. When we get back to your tepee, comb your hair and put rouge on. If you have scents, put some on you and your bed and pillow so you will smell good.”
"Tomorrow morning come down and bathe by your- self. Go back to your tepee and fix yourself up again. This is what you are to do for the next four days. Do this when you are alone.” "Because your husband is so far away,” the woman added, "I don't know if he will make it back in time but he won't like that other woman anymore and he will leave her.” "If he gets back, don't pay any attention to him right away. Make him beg you. Give him a rough time.” 
One day went by, then two and three. Finally, early on the fourth day, just past midnight, Mary heard a horse coming. Her husband must have stopped at other camps and asked which one was hers. He came up to the tepee and stopped. When he came in he looked around. Mary could see him clearly. 
He came over to her and said, "Is that you, Mary?” She hollered, "I'm Mary. What you going to do about it. I don't want to see your face. Get out here.” He said, "No, don't talk like that. I’m lonely. I missed you. That's why I came back to you. I left that other woman. I don't like her. She is no good.” Mary told him, "You are no good just like that woman. Go on and get out of here.” He started crying and Mary thought, "I’d better quit. He might really get mad and leave me again.” Mary grabbed him and hugged him.
They stayed together for a long time. Finally, one day Mary told him that he could leave if he wanted to. She was getting old. That was when they split up for good and she married Queequeesue.
