Raccoon's black eyes and ringed tail
Long ago, raccoons lived by a stream near the great Snake River.
The mother raccoons told all their children not to go near mean Coyote's house.
Raccoon children never had fear of anything. They were always daring each other.
One day, the naughty (kay-sho-und) raccoon told the good (zund) raccoon to go into Coyote's (Isa-peh's) house. They were both curious as to what Coyote's house looked like on the inside. They had heard stories about his mean nature.
Coyote overheard the two raccoons.
He decided to say hello to them. Coyote's charm was beyond belief. The two raccoons couldn't believe their eyes and ears.
Coyote invited them into his home. The two raccoons were amazed at all the pretty things Coyote had.
Coyote pulled out his black, shiny rope and did some rope tricks. He told the raccoons he would teach both of them how to rope. They didnâ€™t know that the rope had sticky, black, soot-like gum on it.
Coyote roped the naughty raccoon first. The rope wrapped around his tail and around his eyes.
After Coyote tied the naughty raccoon, he went after the other one. He tied him up too.
Both raccoons were yelling and screaming.
The mother raccoons ran to rescue their two raccoon children. Coyote couldn't fight both of them, So he released the two children.
The mothers tried to wash all the black, sticky gum off the children's eyes and tails, but they couldn't. The two raccoons never forgot their frightening experience. The gummy film on their eyes and tails never came off. They always felt dirty.
Raccoons still look that way today. And they always wash themselves and their food before they eat.
