Coyote and Trout The Indian Reading Series
One winter day, Coyote went for a walk by a lake. He saw a woman standing not too far away. He thought to himself, “I will walk by and have a closer look.”
As he got near, the woman said, “Coyote, come over here and wrestle with me!” “Ha!” said Coyote. “You must be kidding! I am too strong!”
The woman got hold of Coyote and they wrestled. Finally, Coyote went down. He was dead!
Meanwhile, Fox, who had been traveling here and there, realized he hadn't seen Coyote for quite awhile. He knew something must be wrong. So, being a faithful friend, he went looking for Coyote.
Fox came to the shore of the lake. There he found Coyote's body. Fox used his powers to bring Coyote back to life. With no shame at all, Coyote told how the woman had knocked him out.
Coyote and Fox left together, but hadn't gone too far when they became separated. Coyote wandered back to the place by the lake. Again the lady asked Coyote to wrestle with her. But this time it would be different, because Coyote's powers told him not to get knocked out. It hurt Coyote when she threw him down. He almost passed out. He was so still, the woman thought she had killed him. She turned to run. Coyote jumped up and tried to grab her, but he missed.
The woman ran down to the lake as Coyote chased her. The lake was covered with ice except for a small hole. The woman jumped through the hole, with Coyote right behind! When she was under the water, she turned into a trout. She turned Coyote into a trout, too, and married him. Every morning the trouts would leave camp. When they returned, they would have some meat. This made Coyote very curious because he was greedy and wanted some meat.
One morning Coyote told his wife, “Let me help you bring in the food.” It was all right with her, so he went along. They came to a place where some pieces of meat were dangling in the water. Coyote looked for the biggest piece. When he found it, he grabbed the string with his mouth, pulled and broke it off. He did this all morning. From then on, Coyote went with the trouts every day. Soon he had all the meat, and the other trouts had none.
Meanwhile, Fox, who had been traveling everywhere, heard that the trouts were starving. Right away, Fox knew that Coyote was behind it all. Fox made a fish line out of tough sinew. The next day, he went fishing. The trouts were already biting. Fox threw in his line, hoping to catch Coyote. Coyote grabbed the line because it had the biggest piece of meat. He tried to break the line, but he couldn't. 
Fox pulled his friend out of the water. He took a big club and pretended he was going to kill Coyote. Coyote yelled, “Don’t kill me! I'm your friend, Coyote.” Fox mocked him, saying, “Don’t kill me! I'm your friend, Coyote.” He then asked Coyote, “Why did you do this?” Coyote said, “I married a trout and have been living in the water with them. I didn't mean to harm anyone.”
Fox said to Coyote, “You were almost killed because you tried to take all the meat and left nothing for others. This should teach you not to be so greedy.”
