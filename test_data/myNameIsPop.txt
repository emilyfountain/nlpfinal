My name is pop : a Crow story 
My Name Is Pop is the life story of a pop bottle. Pop tells about when he is full of sweet drink, when he is empty along the side of a road, and when he is finally picked up and filled all over again.
I am a pop bottle. I have many friends. I am full of sweet drink. People like me when I am cold.
I am in a truck. It is moving fast. Sometimes we stop, and they take off some of my friends.
They take me off at the Garryowen Store. A man puts me in a machine. It is cold.
A little boy buys me. He takes off the lid and drinks from me. Now I am empty.
Next to me is an old can. "If someone finds you, they can put more pop in you. And if someone finds me, they can make me into another can.” said the old can.
I hear cars going by. One day a mowing machine goes over us.
Now the grass is brown. The wind blows hard. “The snow will be falling soon” said the old can. “It will be cold.” I can see leaves rolling by. The birds are going south, where there is no snow. Now we are covered with snow.
“The snow will become water one day.” said the old can.
Now the ground is warm again. The sun is bright. The old can said, "Sometimes people come to pick up bottles and cans.”
One day I hear a lot of footsteps. Some children pick me up. They take me back to the store. They have many other empty bottles.
Now I am in a truck. The driver takes in empty boxes. He brings out full boxes of empty bottles.
They wash us with soap and water. It feels good to be clean. We look new.
They fill me with pop. I wonder where I will go this time. Will it be to a store in a city, or to a country store like the one in Garryowen, Montana?
