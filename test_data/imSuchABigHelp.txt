I'm Such a Big Help! A Building Blocks Picture Book for Four-Year-Olds
My name is Jennifer Han. My mother says I have been a big help for as long as she can remember.
Even when I was a baby, I helped her out by feeding myself.
Now that I am four years old, I can help others too. This morning when Dad was getting breakfast, I surprised him by pouring the juice. Dad said, "It is a good thing we have lots more juice in the pantry." Then he told me that tomorrow I can use a smaller pitcher.
I always remember to make my bed, even without Mom reminding me. But Mom reminds me that my pillow would look better at the top of my bed, next to Snuggle Bear.
I just love to dress my baby sister. She loves it, too! Some of her clothes are pretty tight, but when she wiggles and I squeeze, they fit just fine.
Sweeping the floor is a big job for Mom, So I like to help her out. When we work together, the job goes faster.
I also help Mom sort the laundry. My job is putting the socks together. "Rainbows are beautiful, Jennifer," says Mom, "but they look better in the sky than on your feet. We will work together to match up the colors."
In our house, we read a lot of newspapers and I help recycle them. I am pretty strong, so the pile is not as heavy as it looks.
Every night after dinner, I clear the dishes from the table. Mom and Dad Say I am the hardest worker they know. But they say my job will be lots easier if I carry the dishes one at a time.
Mr. Dillon, who lives down the Street, is always happy to See me because I help him weed his garden. "Jennifer," he says, "as long as you are around, I never have to worry about crowded plants!" Yesterday, he helped me see the difference between a flower and a weed. Now I can help him even more.
When Mr. Harrison comes at 3 oâ€™clock, I hold the mailbox open so he can deliver the letters faster. Mr. Harrison says he works better when I help him.
My next-door neighbor, Mrs. Williams, really needs my help. Ever since she sprained her ankle, I have brought her the afternoon paper. "Jennifer," she says, "I just could not manage without you."
My cat needs my help, too. I know that Sneakers just loves it when I brush his fur. We even play a game where he makes me catch him first.
My Mom says I am such a big help she cannot believe it. But if she thinks I help her a lot now, just wait until I turn five.
