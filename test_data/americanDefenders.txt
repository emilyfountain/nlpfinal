American defenders of land, sea & sky
America's historic battlefields, forts, lighthouses, ships and drydocks, aircraft, landing fields, and rocket sites hold fascinating stories of our nation's "common defense." They show us firsthand the importance of America's military presence at home and abroad as well as the often tragic consequences of war and the collective yearning for a stable, lasting peace. Moreover, their 200-year history is closely linked with many of today's national defense issues. Most of all, though, these places from the past reflect our sense of purpose, spirit, and continuity. In the future—as in the past—our country's "common defense," based on the Constitution and shaped by the President and Congress we elect, will be car- ried out by men and women dedicated to service in the U.S. armed forces. American Defenders of Land, Sea & Sky presents a wide range of military activities from the American Revolution to the Cold War era following World War II. It includes those activities that were enthusiastically supported by the American public as well as some that were not. Each chapter begins with a brief history of the period to provide a political and social background for our military involvements. The book makes clear that the values we, as a nation, have pledged to uphold and, if necessary, fight for, are those principles established by the Founding Fathers in our Constitution. In this trip through American history, you'll visit forts and battle sites in the North, South, East and West; climb aboard old ships and a modern submarine; experience the excitement of early avia- tion; hear the roar of pioneering space vehicles; note the special places where peace treaties were signed; and view monuments that serve to honor the many people who have been lost to war over time. The majority of the buildings, structures, and sites in the book are National Historic Landmarks, our country's most significant historic places as designated by the Secretary of the Interior. Many of these Landmarks are owned by the Department of Defense—the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines, and also the Coast Guard during times of war. Several are famous National Parks that most people have heard of and many others have visited! Most of Roxie Munro's wonderful drawings show the Landmarks and other great places as they look today or in the very recent past. A few are drawn as they would have appeared long ago in our nation's history, based on photographs and other documentation. Look for the three kids in the drawings as they follow in the footsteps of the American Defenders. Maybe you can visit some of these places with your family or on a school trip. A Guide is included that tells whether the site is open on a regular basis, open by special appointment, or restricted to the public.
The thirteen American colonies wanted to be free from rule by Great Britain. Freedom would make it possible to create a new kind of government without a king! In the democracy envisioned by our country's earliest leaders, Americans would govern themselves based on certain principles or ideals. The American Revolution Few people at the time thought that the American Revolution would succeed and the Americans could win a war against the world's greatest empire. At the beginning of the war, there was no regular American army, just a militia made up of civilians—and most of them were farmers! Naturally, they were not used to long campaigns or battles with British Regulars, and thousands quit. General Washington begged the Continental Congress to provide a regular army of men enlisted for a long term, but Congress felt that step would violate civil liberties. It was only after so many American defeats threatened the war effort that Congress agreed to offer extra pay to officers and privates and pledged to see the war to an end. The American Revolution raised many questions about the role of government and the place of the military within it. Remember, there was no President until 1789, and no Congress as we know it today. A nation was truly in the making—and it might have failed. But with the great energy and sense of common purpose that defines us, Americans eventually forced the British to sue for peace and grant America its independence.
Lexington Green Lexington, Massachusetts By 1775, tension between the colonies and the mother country had reached the breaking point. General Gage, who was in charge of the British troops in Boston, learned that Samuel Adams and John Hancock were in Lexington—about 20 miles from Boston. Hearing that the colonists had hidden a large collection of weapons in nearby Concord, Gage sent a detachment of soldiers to seize the rebel leaders and destroy the stores of ammunition.
We clashed with the Kings soldiers at dawn. You probably know the rest! Sons of Liberty Paul Revere and William Dawes rode to warn Adams and Hancock of the impending British attack by way of the Charles River, the most direct route. Just as the sun was rising on April 19, 1775, British soldiers reached Lexington. A straggling line of colonists was already waiting on the green —armed with muskets! Although leaders on both sides issued stern warn- ings not to fire, a shot suddenly rang out! The Minutemen stood motionless. To this day, no one knows which side fired the first shot, but it was followed by a volley of shots by the Redcoats. Eight Minutemen were killed and several others wounded. This first skirmish on Lexington Green signaled the beginning of the American Revolution.
Independence Hall Independence National Historical Park Philadelphia, Pennsylvania By the time the Second Continental Congress convened on May 10, 1775, war had already broken out in Massachusetts. Young Thomas Jefferson was chosen to write a document explaining why the colonies should be free from British rule. His words would have to be powerful enough to shape a nation. Jefferson said the King of England was "unfit to be a ruler of a free people" and "that all men are created equal..." On July 4, 1776, his essay, known as the Declaration of Independence, was adopted by the Congress. It was printed in newspapers and read at public gatherings in every city and village. On July 8th, Philadelphia's now famous bell rang out to proclaim "liberty throughout the land."
Independence Hall Independence Hall was the meeting place of the Constitutional Convention four years after the American Revolution had ended. Fifty- five delegates met here from May to September, 1787, to choose the best way to govern and protect our new nation. The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to "provide for the common defense." Before the Constitution, each state raised its own militia for defense. Now, military forces would be raised by Congress to protect the whole United States. The President was made Commander-in-Chief of the military. By June 26, 1788, all the states had ratified the Constitution. Together, the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution—with its Bill of Rights—are the most important documents in our nation's history.
Cliveden (The Chew House) Philadelphia, Pennsylvania On a foggy October morning in 1777, General George Washington's soldiers attacked British troops in the small village of Germantown. About 120 retreating British soldiers broke into a large stone house called Cliveden, left vacant while its owners stayed in Philadelphia. Barricading themselves behind the thick walls, the British began to fire on Washington's troops. When Washington ordered a full-scale assault on Cliveden, it turned out to be a serious mistake. Musket fire aimed at the enemy inside passed through the front and rear windows, striking American soldiers behind the house! After several hours, the Redcoats continued to hold Cliveden. Even though we lost the battle, the French were so impressed by the American spirit—and our earlier victory at Saratoga—they decided to enter the War as an ally.
Sandy Hook Light Gateway National Recreation Area Sandy Hook, New Jersey Built in 1764, Sandy Hook Light must have been a welcome sight for merchant ships bringing goods to the colonies after dark. Then in March, 1776, the light tower was attacked by the British Navy. Retreating American colonists took the operating mechanism of the light apart to keep the enemy from using it. When the war was over, the British returned the light tower to the United States, and the Americans re-assembled it! Sandy Hook Light has been shining brightly ever since, continuing to lead ships safely into New York Harbor. Owned and maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard, it is the oldest standing light tower in the United States.
Americas involvement in the War of 1812 was confusing to many people living in 1812 and is still confusing to many people today. President Madison's war message to Congress made a strong case for the need to fight with Britain for Neutral Rights. He said that Britain was preying on American commerce, seizing her sailors, and supporting restless Indians on the frontier. At the same time, America had an interest in conquering Florida and annexing Canada. The congressional vote to enter the War of 1812 showed that many Americans were unclear about whether to fight and exactly what the war was all about. Public support in New England was limited while Americans in the South and West strongly supported it. The War of 1812 The War of 1812 with Britain was difficult for the new Nation. There were many losses, and the White House in Washington, D.C. was burned by the British. However, the early victory of the U.S. Navy, the leadership of able generals such as Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison, and key American victories at Fort McHenry and at New Orleans finally stirred public support for the war. At its close, Americans turned their energies to exploring and settling the American continent in a fury of westward expansion.
Chalmette Unit Jean La Fitte National Historical Park Arabi, Louisiana American morale was at an all-time low when the British captured the City of Washington and burned the White House. Many people were unhappy about the Treaty of Ghent negotiated in Belgium on December 24, 1814, to end the War of 1812. They felt the document was weak and would not be honored. Then General Andrew Jackson's leadership at the Battle of New Orleans changed everything! The battles with British troops at Chalmette on December 28, 1814, and January 1 and 8, 1815, are among the most decisive American military victories in our history. We gained a renewed sense of national pride and the Treaty of Ghent was quickly ratified by Congress. The Chalmette monument was built between 1855 and 1908 to honor Americans who fought at the Battle of New Orleans. 20
Octagon House Washington, D.C. The Octagon House was built by Colonel John Tayloe for his family between 1801 and 1802. The Tayloe children gave the house its distinctive name, although the building does not really have eight sides. After the British set fire to the White House, President James Madison and his family moved here to have a safe place to live. In the early months of 1815, President Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent in the upstairs parlor. This important treaty declared that England and the United States were finally at peace. It also proved that our new nation was now strong enough to protect itself.
After Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance in 1787, pioneers began to cross the Allegheny Mountains into the territory north of the Ohio River. More settlers moved westward in the early 1800s, after the explorations of Zebulon Pike and John C. Fremont. Going West meant land, trapping and trading, and gold—in short, economic opportunity! Within a few years after the War of 1812, Americans used the resources of the continent to create one of the world s richest countries and expand the Nation's boundaries from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. The Struggle for Western Territory The incredible 19th century search for a better way of life was driven by improvements in transportation and communication—and our superior weaponry. We invented the steam engine and power-driven machines, such as reapers. We opened the Erie Canal, developed a large network of post roads, and invented the electric telegraph. The railroads had a major impact on the old, slower ways of life. By 1869, the last spike had been driven on the central line to the Pacific and travel from coast to coast was possible in days instead of weeks. During this time—led by a series of expansionist Presidents—the United States fought a war with Mexico from 1845 to 1848, annexed Texas and California, and settled the Oregon territory. Native Americans were pushed aside and eventually settled onto reservations to make way for the new states.
Fort Leavenworth Military Reservation Fort Leavenworth, Kansas After the War of 1812, many people felt that white settlers and Indian tribes could never live together in peace. Fort Leavenworth was established in 1827 by President James Monroe and Congress as part of a "Permanent Indian Frontier" to keep the two cultures apart. Fort Snelling, Fort Atkinson, and Fort Scott, were some of the other posts. During this period, the Army at Fort Leavenworth protected caravans of fur traders, explorers, and white settlers rolling westward across Indian lands. In the 1830s, when Indian tribes from the East were moved to the West by President Andrew Jackson, the Army was also in charge of keeping the peace. The officers and men at Fort Leavenworth lived in houses overlooking a central parade ground. The oldest one, built it 1834, is named the "Rookery."
John Ross House Rossville, Georgia John Ross, a powerful Chief of the Cherokee Nation, lived in a one- story log house on the Coosa River near Rome, Georgia. He served as spokesman to the white Georgian settlers. Georgians wanted the Cherokee land for their own, especially after gold was discovered in 1828. In 1830, a state law was passed to remove the Cherokee Nation to Oklahoma. Chief Ross protested, but the Cherokee and four other Indian Nations lost the political battle to President Andrew Jackson. In the winter of 1838, General Winfield Scott and 7,000 government soldiers were ordered to move the Cherokees West. The Indians suffered from food shortages, illness, and exposure. Of the 17,000 Cherokees who began the trip, as many as 5,000 died along the way. The road they travelled is called the "Trail of Tears."
The Alamo San Antonio, Texas You probably know the name of this old Spanish church, but do you remember its story? After 1821, Mexicans and white settlers were fighting for control of the land we now call Texas. The Texans cap- tured the Alamo from Mexico in 1835. In January, 1836, they heard that Santa Anna and 5,000 soldiers were crossing the Mexican border, but it was too late to call in the United States Army. A small group of Texan volunteers took refuge in the Alamo and, on February 24, 1836, the famous siege began! The Texans held out for thirteen days, but were eventually outnumbered by the Mexican soldiers. All 187 defenders of the Alamo were killed, including James Bowie and Davy Crockett. "Remember the Alamo" became the battlecry that spurred the defeat of Santa Anna and the drive for Texas statehood.
Fort Point National Historic Site San Francisco, California In 1853, the War Department decided to build a fort in San Francisco Bay as a western defense against attacks from the sea. Carpenters, teamsters and laborers worked hard to reduce the rocky site from ninety-seven feet to sixteen feet above sea level. Then they construct- ed the barracks, mess hall, stables, powder magazine, and blacksmith shop. By 1859, a visitor to the site said the fort was "four tiers in height, the topmost of which is 64 feet above low tide; and capable of mounting 150 guns..." Fort Point stood ready to defend the harbor entrance from attack during the Civil War, but no battle was ever fought here. Its powerful cannons would fire salutes whenever news of Union victories arrived!
Modern historians call the Civil War the "first modern war" in American history. During this time, factories in the North produced guns and supplies for the war effort; railroads crisscrossed the country moving supplies and armies; generals used the telegraph to communicate over large distances; and a new ironclad navy driven by steam power blockaded the south. The scope of the struggle increased the power of industry and government in the North and led to the destruction of large areas of the South as the armies marched back and forth. The Civil War In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln pledged "a new birth of freedom" in his now-famous Gettysburg Address. For African Americans this would mean freedom from slavery. With the passage of the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution, African Americans were guaranteed their civil rights on an equal basis with white Americans. Thomas Jefferson's words stated in the Declaration of Independence in 1776 "that all men are created equal" now had meaning for millions of Americans that had been excluded from the social compact.
Watervliet Arsenal /ran Storehouse Albanv, New York The Army built Watervliet Arsenal in 1813, then added this iron store- house in 1859. Large quantities of raw materials could now be kept on hand, and weapons production could be increased. For example, a new bullet press was able to make 33,000 bullets a day instead of 290,000 a month. With the fall of Fort Sumter and the start of the Civil War in 1861, the arsenal went into full swing. It produced gun shot, cast balls, and cannon carriages, then shipped them out on the Hudson River and by railroad to Union forts. Of the 2,000 employees at Watervliet Arsenal, 500 were children! They filled bullet cartridges with gun powder. Today, the iron storehouse is an ordnance museum.
The National Museum of Health and Medicine Armed Forces Institute of Pathology Washington, D.C. Union Army surgeon General William A. Hammond established this fascinating museum in 1862 as a national center for the study of injuries and disease. He ordered doctors on battlefields to send limbs and specimens—packed in whisky as a preservative—so they could be dissected for educational purposes. Today, if you visit the museum you can see surgical implements from the Civil War period, including a bone saw. You can also see 19th century dental instruments, including a wind-up tooth drill and a twist-and-pull extraction tool. In all, the museum houses almost 17,000 anatomical specimens and 12,000 historical artifacts. 
Ford's Theater National Historic Site Washington, D.C. On April 14, 1865, President and Mrs. Lincoln were attending a peformance of "Our American Cousin" at Ford's Theater. The celebration turned to tragedy when actor John Wilkes Booth entered the Presidents box and shot him in the head at point-blank range. President Lincoln was carried across the street to the Petersen House where he died a few hours later. Booth fled, but was found hiding in a barn in southern Maryland and was shot by federal soldiers. Other conspirators were captured, imprisoned at nearby Fort McNair, and hanged. Abraham Lincoln was the first United States President to be assassinated. A period of national mourning was declared. The loss of a President was marked by a sign on the door of Ford's Theater that said, "Closed by Order of the Secretary of War."
Pension Building Washington, D.C. The Pension Building was designed and built by Army Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs between 1882 and 1887. It served both as a home for the U.S. Pension Bureau and a memorial to Americans who fought in the Civil War. Bohemian born sculptor, Casper Buberl, constructed a three-foot tall, 1200-foot long decorative panel (called a "frieze") around the building. General Meigs had infantry, cavalry, artillery, and navy units—dressed in full uniform—model for the parade of figures portrayed in the frieze. During construction, metal cases containing Civil War documents, such as battlefield maps and Official Records of the War of Rebellion, were built into the huge interior columns as a time capsule to keep them safe. Today, the Pension Building is home to the National Building Museum. 39
By the close of the nineteenth century, the United States stretched across the continent, and the Nation began to expand its power abroad. Under the prodding of naval officers, such as Alfred Thayer Mahan, and civilians such as Teddy Roosevelt, America began to build a modern steel navy and estab- lish naval stations both at home and around the world. At this time, Spain's possessions included Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Atlantic Ocean, and the Philippines and Guam in the Pacific Ocean. The Spanish-American War After the inauguration of President William McKinley in 1897, American attention increasingly focused on the island of Cuba, just ninety miles from Florida. Spain was trying to stop a rebellion in Cuba using harsh methods. Continuing newspaper reports of Spanish atrocities and the sinking of the American battleship, USS Maine, in Havana Harbor caused American feel- ings toward Spain to turn hostile. At the same time, the rebellious Cubans were demanding concessions from their Spanish overseers. When these demands were not met, the United States Congress declared war on Spain in April, 1898. The Spanish-American War showed that the U.S. Navy was much better pre- pared to fight than the U.S. Army. Within a short time, naval victories in the Philippines and Cuba, coupled with the landing of the U.S. Army in Cuba, led to the end of the war. A peace treaty between Spain and the United States was signed in December, 1898. Cuba was granted its independence, but the United States decided to keep the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico for a few years. America now had an overseas empire.
Mare Island Naval Shipyard Drydock 1 Vallejo, California In 1848, President Millard Filmore decided to build a permanent dry- dock on the west coast so Navy personnel could maintain and clean their great ships. Commander David Farragut was put in charge of constructing the Navy Yard on a 956-acre tract of land called "Mare Island." Work on the nation's first drydock began in 1872. When the cement, gravel, and stone "cradle" was finally completed in 1891, it was 525.9 feet long. That's almost two football fields! Mare Island Naval Shipyard was America's most important naval installation during and after the Civil War—and also became an important builder of warships. In 1898, at the start of the Spanish-American War, sailors on Mare Island were busier than ever getting the Navy's fleet ready for battle in the Philippines.
USS Olympia Philadelphia, Pennsylvania In April, 1898, President McKinley declared war on Spain. An American fleet commanded by Admiral George Dewey was ordered to proceed to the Philippines and attack Spanish warships as they lay at anchor in Manila Harbor. Dewey's flagship, the USS Olympia, was more heavily armed than earlier U.S. cruisers and could also move much faster at 21.4 knots (that's over 24 miles an hour). On May Day at dawn, the Olympia steamed into the waters of Manila Bay, launch- ing the first shell at the Spanish ships. When the entire American fleet opened fire, the Spanish were quickly defeated. A peace treaty was signed in December, 1898. Three of Spain's possessions—the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam—were ceded to the United States. In the same year, the Hawaiian Islands were annexed. But that's another story.
Tampa Bay Hotel Tampa, Florida The Tampa Bay Hotel, with its silver spires called "minarets," was built in the 1890s as a resort and health spa. With the start of the Spanish- American War, the U.S. military decided to use the hotel as its head- quarters for the invasion of Cuba. The resort was a hub of activity as journalists from newspapers and magazines gathered there to report on the war. And thousands of American soldiers being sent to Central America set up camp nearby. Among them were the men who would become known as Theodore Roosevelts' Rough Riders. After the American Navy destroyed the Spanish Fleet near the harbor of Santiago, Cuba, Roosevelt's Rough Riders and the Army overtook key Spanish fortifications on San Juan Hill.
When World War I began in Europe in 1914, the official position of the United States was one of neutrality, although many Americans were sympathetic to England and France. As the war continued, President Wilson still wanted to keep America out of the war but, at the same time, he wanted to protect our rights to trade and travel anywhere in the world. This proved to be difficult. Both England and Germany stopped American ships and disrupted our freedom of passage. America and World War I By 1917, as the war in Europe was reaching its climax, Germany announced a total blockade of England that would include the stopping and sinking of American ships. In response, President Woodrow Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany in April, 1917. By the time the war was over in November of 1918, millions of Americans were serving with the Army in Europe; American factories and farms were supplying an abundance of goods to the English and French people; and President Woodrow Wilson was a hero all over the world. President Wilson traveled to France in 1919 to lead the American delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. He was the first American President to travel abroad while in office.
In October, 1929, the price of stocks and other securities began to decline. The decline increased so rapidly that many people sold their stocks in a panic. The stock market collapsed! Within a few months, thousands of businesses closed and millions of Americans lost their jobs. President Hoover was concerned, but seemed powerless to help. Between World Wars By 1933, America was in the depths of the Great Depression and a new President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, was in office. Roosevelt gave Americans hope that the economy would improve when he promised a "New Deal" for all. Congress passed emergency relief, recovery, and reform legislation. Americans returned to work, and the economy slowly began to improve. Roosevelt gave Americans jobs constructing many large public works projects, such as buildings, dams, and roads and by ordering new ships for the Navy and supplies for the Army. As President Roosevelt's second term drew to a close in 1940, more and more of the President's attention was devoted to foreign affairs. He worried about our relationship with the Japanese in the Pacific and with Germany and Italy in Europe as the clouds of war once again began to appear on the American horizon.
Hangar No. 1, Lakehurst Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey Germany invented huge hydrogen-filled balloons called "dirigibles" for use in World War I. In 1921, the United States started its own dirigible program. An enormous hangar almost 1000 feet long and 200 feet high was constructed! Inside, Naval engineers built America's first dirigible, the Shenandoah. Lighter-than-air craft were also being used for commercial passenger travel and, by 1928, the Lakehurst facility was an international airport. But when Germany's largest passenger airship, Hindenburg, exploded in flames while landing here in 1937, the United States cancelled the Navy's dirigible program. Because blimps had a better safety record, the Navy used them to pro- tect our ships from enemy submarine attacks during World War II. The hangar looks different now that training activities take place in it.
Hickam Field Hickam Air Force Base Honolulu, Hawaii America's Army Air Corps was the flying branch of the U.S. military before we had an Air Force. The Corps built Hickam Field near Pearl Harbor Naval Base in 1935 as Hawaii's main Army airfield. Only six years later, when relations between the United States and Japan were at an all-time low, America sent its powerful B-17 bombers to Hickam Field in increasing numbers. From the air you can see how the three run- ways formed a triangle. This was the flight line where the B-17 Flying Fortress usually parked. America felt safe, with its superior air power at Hickam Field and the mighty Pacific Fleet next door at Pearl Harbor. But all that was to change on an early December morning in 1941.
Japan and America had enjoyed open trade since 1854, but relations became more and more strained during the first three decades of the 20th century, as Japan invaded Korea, Manchuria, and the Chinese mainland. When Japan, Italy, and Germany became allies in 1940, diplomatic relations with the United States reached a breaking point. Then, the seemingly impossible happened! On December 7, 1941, Japan bombed American ships in Honolulu, Hawaii. America and World War II The next day, America was once again at war. World War II brought modern warfare closer to more Americans than any other conflict in our history. Millions of American men and women served in the armed forces, or worked in the factories, farms and mines to serve the nation. At home, the war caused major social changes as families were uprooted and normal lives were disrupted. Opportunity accompanied change when women joined the labor force in large numbers. Unemployment vanished and incomes rose. Sadly, thousands of Japanese Americans were forced from their homes to live in internment camps for the duration of the war. Abroad, the American Army, Navy, and Marines fought from Europe to the Pacific. American factories and farms sent arms, clothing, food and ammunition to American allies all over the world. American technology strengthened the weapons of war, eventually resulting in the world's first use of the atomic bomb in 1945.
USS Utah Honolulu, Hawaii On December 7, 1941, Americans were stunned when they listened to the news on their radios. Japanese warplanes had bombed and strafed Hickam Field, then struck Pearl Harbor! The mighty Pacific Fleet was nearly destroyed as torpedoes, bombs, and projectiles slammed into American ships and aircraft. The Utah capsized, and many other American battleships were sunk or damaged. Scores of military personnel were wounded or killed. The next day, President Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war against Japan. Within one hour, Congress consented. Several damaged battleships were repaired for the long war. But the USS Utah and the USS Arizona remain in the bay at Pearl Harbor to honor the lives of those who died during the surprise attack on our nation's shore.
Drydock 4 Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Bremerton, Washington This vast concrete pit at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard is known as Drydock 4. It was one of two 1,000-foot long ship repair facilities constructed here around the beginning of World War II. These enormous drydocks could hold the largest, fastest battleships of the time. Following the bombing of the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, the USS Tennessee, Maryland, Nevada, California, and West Virginia were all sent from Hawaii to Bremerton's Drydock 4 for critical repairs. Then they were returned to active duty for the remainder of World War II. By the end of the war, this famous shipyard had repaired, overhauled, and modernized 344 fighting ships of all types.
The Pentagon Arlington, Virginia President Franklin D. Roosevelt decided to build a new headquarters for the Department of Defense on a site close to Washington, D.C. Construction began in 1941. In just two years, a crew of 4,000 people worked 24 hours a day in three shifts to finish the largest federal office building in America. Even though the building is 6,546,360 square feet and has five floors, you can walk to the farthest point from any location in less than ten minutes because of the clever interior design. Today, the famous five-sided building houses almost 24,000 men and women of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard, who work together to protect the United States and the nations interests abroad.
The White House 7600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW Washington, D.C. European rulers of the past lived behind high walls or far away from their people in country estates. As part of the democratic ideal, the house and grounds of the White House were designed to be open and accessible to the American people. Franklin D. Roosevelt was in the White House both before and during World War II. When Roosevelt was re-elected to a fourth term of office in 1944, the war was not yet over. For security reasons, the formal oath of office was given inside the White House. This is the only time a President has not been inaugurated outdoors in a public ceremony.
Trinity Site Missile Range White Sands, New Mexico American, British, and Canadian scientists were here for the test, as well as an enormous staff of soldiers and technicians. At 5:29:45 a.m. Mountain War Time on July 16, 1945, they witnessed the explosion of the first atomic bomb. The bomb, called the "Fat Man," was about 5-feet tall with a core of plutonium metal and electrical detonators that looked like spark plugs. The blast was so powerful that sand at ground zero was fused into a green glassy substance called "trinitite." On August 6, 1945, President Harry S. Truman ordered an atomic bomb to be dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. A second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki on August 9th. When Japan surrendered five days later, World War II had finally come to a close. This modest lava stone monument marks a turning point in world history.
Soon after World War II, the United States joined other nations to create a world peace-keeping organization called the United Nations. We helped our allies abroad by lending them money to re-build their damaged towns and cities. At home, millions of returning servicemen and servicewomen returned to school under scholarships provided by the American government. Millions more bought houses with low-cost government loans. These benefits to service men and women and the increased buying power from wages earned in the wartime factories led to general prosperity in the country. America After World War II But even as the United Nations was being established in 1945, President Truman had to confront a crisis overseas with the Soviet Union. Within two years, these powers were locked in a "Cold War" that was fought across a line that divided eastern from western Europe. The political war of words broke into open warfare in 1950 with the beginning of the Korean War. As Americans fought and died for freedom in Korea, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy began an intense hunt for communists in the United States. Many people felt that freedom of speech was seriously threatened during this era. The term "McCarthyism" was born. In 1952, Dwight D. Eisenhower won the presidency by pledging to end the war in Korea and strengthen America's defenses. "Mamie" Eisenhower christened the first American nuclear submarine, the USS Nautilus, two years later.
