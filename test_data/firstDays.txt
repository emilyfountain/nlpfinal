First days of the world
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED how the world began? Have you wondered about the first living things, and how plants, animals, and people came to be? Scientists, too, have wondered. They have searched the sky, the sea, the rocks of the Earth. They have tried to find out what happened from the beginning of time. The scientists have made many discoveries, and have put them together in a story of the first days of the world. Parts of the story are surely true, but other parts are filled in with guesses. We can never know everything that happened millions and millions of years ago. And that is when our story begins.
Long, long ago there was no world. There was no Sun nor Moon. No stars shone. Everywhere, there was only dark space. Space was almost empty, but not quite. Here and there was a speck of dust or an atom of gas. The specks and atoms drifted around. But they were scattered so far apart, they seldom touched one another. As time went on, billions of specks and atoms gath- ered in great, thin clouds. In each cloud, gravity began pulling atoms and dust specks toward the center. The cloud shrank. Its specks and atoms crowded close, and so they often crashed. This created heat. The center of the cloud grew so hot, it began to glow. It became a star. Millions of clouds became stars. Now there was light in the darkness of space.
In one of the clouds, a great storm raged streams of gases set the cloud whirling. As it whirled, it flattened into the shape of a vast pinwheel, with streamers I I‘ I‘0 ‘ around the rim. The pinwheel turned and turned in the sky. Gradually, gases were pulled to the center of the wheel. There they packed into a huge, glowing ball. This glowing ball became the Sun.
Streamers of gas and dust trailed around the Sun. The streamers broke up and turned into whirlpools. Each whirlpool circled the Sun in its own path. Some were near the Sun; others were far away. In whirlpools near the Sun, it was hot. In those farther away, it was cold. In each whirlpool, the dust specks and gas atoms went round and round. Some of the atoms formed water vapor, which settled on the dust as dew. When dust specks met, they were pasted together by the dew. Sometimes they froze into gobs of muddy slush.
Millions of gobs floated around in each whirlpool. Gravity began drawing them together, until they joined and formed larger masses. Then the masses crashed and joined. They built a giant, spinning ball. Its gravity pulled in chunks of matter near its path. The giant ball grew and grew. Finally it became a world—a planet. Out of nine whirlpools, nine planets formed. Each planet traveled in its own path around the Sun. Mercury circled nearest the Sun. Then came Venus, Earth, and Mars. Beyond Mars circled the giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Far beyond Neptune was Pluto.
The Sun shone on all the planets, and sunlight gave them their day. On the Earth, as on every planet, night followed day, and day followed night. Because of the spin- ning, some part of the planet was always turning away from the Sun and beginning its night. Some part was always turning toward the Sun and beginning its day.
But what a strange kind of day it was! The Sun blazed in a black sky. And in the darkness around the Sun, stars twinkled. The daytime sky was black because space began right above the earth. There was no air, as there is now, to catch the Sunlight and make the sky look blue.
While the Earth was forming, gases had drifted away into space. That is why there was no air. The gas called water vapor had drifted away, too. No rain clouds could form, so there was no rain. There were no rivers, nor lakes, nor ocean waters. The Earth was a ball of dry, bare rock. Yet inside the planet lay a hidden treasure. Wisps of water vapor and other gases had been buried long ago with the gobs of mud. Now these gases were trapped as bubbles in the Earth's rock. The rock also held atoms of a special kind. They were atoms that broke apart and gave off heat. They went on creating heat for millions of years. Deep down, rock became so hot that it melted into lava. The lava foamed with bubbling gases. It gushed from volcanoes and flooded the ground. The gases blasted from the volcanoes. Spreading around the planet, they formed a veil of air. Water vapor cooled and gathered into clouds, and the first rains fell. It rained and rained. For millions of years it rained, and for millions of years water poured into the Earth's hollows. That was how the ocean began.
Today, mountain ranges pierce the clouds, and deep trenches gash the ﬂoor of the sea. But when the Earth was young it had no mountains nor ocean deeps. Seas were shal- low; lands were low. Then, deep inside the planet, a layer of hot rock began to cool. As it cooled, it shrank. The shrinking made it pull and tug on the layers of rock above. This upper rock was so hard and solid, it could not shrink. The deep rock went on tugging. Slowly, the layers above began to buckle. They crumpled into gigantic folds. In some places the rock arched upward, forming mountains. In other places it sagged downward, making trenches under the sea.
Ages passed, and the rocks of the Earth were still bare. Nowhere was there any sign of life. No plant nor animal could have lived then. Poison gases fumed out of the Earth, making a poisonous air. Yet in this air were the kinds of atoms necessary for life. In time they would form the bodies of the first living things. Perhaps this is how it came about. When raindrops formed, gases of the air dissolved in the drops. Storms were always raging, now in one place, now in another. Lightning flashed, and thunder crashed. The power of the lightning worked on atoms in the raindrops. Atoms be- came linked into tiny clumps, or molecules. More and more molecules formed. When it rained, molecules fell to the land and the sea. Rainwater trickled over rock. Minerals were washed away, and were carried by rivers to the sea. For millions of years, substances from the air and the rocks poured into the sea. The water became a broth of the kinds of molecules that were to make up the first living things. These molecules were the stuff of life, but they were not alive.
The molecules drifted and drifted in the sea. Often they met and clung together, forming droplets of jelly-like stuff. These droplets took in more molecules, which they used as food. Nourished by the food, the droplets grew and grew. When a droplet reached a certain size, it split in two. Both of these grew large, then split, and there were four. And so it went. The droplets kept on growing and mak- ing more of their own kind. Nothing like this had ever happened before. The droplets were something new in the world. They were living things! The living droplets multiplied, until hordes and hordes of them crowded the sea. All took food molecules from the water. The broth became thin. Then there was famine in the sea. Millions of living droplets starved. Some of the droplets developed green matter that trapped rays of sunlight. The rays gave them energy. They began to work like tiny factories. Using water and a gas from the air, they made their own food. These food- making droplets were the first plants. Droplets of another kind began to live by eating the plants. These were the first animals. Today the ocean still has hordes of tiny plants and animals. They are so small that hundreds can float in a drop of water.
Billions and billions of tiny creatures came to life in the sea. Many were different from one another, and differ- ent from the creatures that had lived before them. Some of the droplet animals would split, and the two new droplets would stick together. Then these would split, and all four would stick together. And so it went, until there was a creature much bigger than any single droplet. Thus there came to be new, larger kinds of animals in the sea. Creatures of one family were somewhat like the crabs and shrimps of today. They had jointed legs and a shell, but no bones. They could swim with their legs, but perhaps they spent most of their time crawling along the sea floor, feeding on dead plants and animals. Creatures of another family were wormlike things that wriggled through the water. In time, members of this family developed backbones and became fishes. Some kinds of fishes grew larger and larger. Their backbones strengthened their bodies, so they could flip their tails and whip through the water. Great fishes became kings of the sea. 
Most creatures of the sea were eventually eaten by others. But some had a different sort of end. They died, and their bodies sank to the bottom of the sea. And there they lay. In the water above floated billions of tiny flakes of clay. These particles were always drifting down. They settled on the ocean floor as mud, which buried the dead animals. Layers of mud piled up, one upon another. Slowly, the deep mud turned to rock. So did the shells and bones and other parts of the buried animals. Millions of years passed. In certain places, the floor of the sea rose and became dry land. Where mud and sand were washed away, the rock was uncovered. And there in the rock lay stony shapes of the shells and bones. These were fossils—traces of ancient living things. From the fossils we can see what kinds of creatures lived in the ocean long ago.
While the ocean teemed with living things, the land was still lifeless. Not a plant grew anywhere. Not an animal stirred. Signs of life appeared only along the beaches, where plants and animals of the sea were cast ashore and died. In time, new kinds of plants developed in the sea. Some of them clung to the bottom of shallow bays. During low tide they were left out of water, yet they did not dry up. They had tough skins, which protected them from the air. So they lived, and spread around the swampy shores. There they developed into rushes, mosses, and ferns. Some of these plants grew taller and taller. Finally they became trees, and forests began to cover the swamps.
Small creatures with jointed legs sometimes crawled ashore. They had tough shells that kept them from drying up. They settled in the swamps, and became the ﬁrst ani- mals to live on land. For millions of years, joint-legged creatures crawled around in the swamps and forests. From them came several great families. These were the insects, spiders, scorpions, centipedes, and millepedes.
Many fishes swam in shallow bays and lagoons. These were dangerous places. Often the water was poisoned by rotting plants. Yet the fishes did not die. In those days fishes had lungs as well as gills. When the water was unfit for breathing, they would come to the surface, poke their faces out, and breathe air. The fins of these fishes were set on strong, muscular stubs. Such fins were needed in the shallow waters. When a pool dried up and fishes were left in the mud, they used their fins to get away. Off they crawled, looking for another pool.
In time, these fishes changed, and from them came a creature that was not a fish at all. It was an amphibian— the first backboned animal to live on land. Instead of fins, the amphibian had short, sprawling legs, with which it crawled along the ground. The amphibian laid its eggs in water. They were tiny and soft, like fish eggs. The young ones that hatched from them were tadpoles. Later, their lungs and legs grew, and they crawled out on land. Today, the only amphibians in the world are frogs, toads, and salamanders. Like their ancestors, they lay tiny eggs in water, and the young ones hatch as tadpoles.
Amphibians got along very well in swamps and marshes. But then the land rose, and marshes dried up. Few places were left where amphibians could lay their eggs. So most of them died out. But certain amphibians lived, and changed. And from them, in time, came a new kind of creature. This was the reptile. The ﬁrst reptile looked like an amphibian. But its egg wasn’t at all like an amphibian’s egg. It was large, and had a tough protecting shell. The reptile egg was laid on land. The shell kept it from drying up. The yolk of the reptile egg held a lot of food. That was good for the unhatched young one. It stayed in the egg for a long time, growing and growing. When it hatched, the young reptile was not a tadpole. It had lungs and legs, and was ready to live on land.
Many kinds of reptiles developed. Some were the size of chickens. They ran on two legs, and used their front paws to grasp food. Can you guess what these little creatures were? They were the first dinosaurs. Big dino- saurs came later. Nearly everywhere, rain fell often. Then the clouds lifted, and the sun poured down its light and warmth. Plants flourished, covering the land with their lush green leaves. Many of the little dinosaurs were plant-eaters. Their food was plentiful, so they were able to grow and grow. For millions of years, young ones grew bigger than their parents. Finally, some kinds became giants. They were so heavy that they could not stand on two legs—they had to go on all fours. Other dinosaurs were flesh-eaters. They, too, became giants. Some were two-legged monsters with teeth like daggers. They strode along, heads high in the air, hunting the dinosaurs that fed on plants.
Several kinds of reptiles hunted amphibians in shal- low waters. As time went on, these reptiles changed. Their feet developed into flippers. They swam well, and began to rove the open sea. One reptile of the sea looked like a big fish. It had a streamlined body and a forked tail. It swam so power- fully, it was able to catch the swiftest game in the sea. This fishlike reptile never went ashore—not even to lay eggs. Its young were born alive in the water. Another sea rover had a body like a turtle's, but the neck was long and snaky. The creature would raise its head high, looking for prey. When it saw a fish, it struck like a snake.
Reptiles of one family developed wings, and flew. Their wing was really an arm and hand shaped for flying. The little finger grew very long. A web of skin spread from the finger and the arm, forming a wing. Three smaller fingers with claws stuck out at the crook of the wing. They were used for clinging to trees. The earliest flying reptile was only as big as a sparrow. Later kinds were larger. The wings of one kind spread as wide as the wings of a small plane. The flying reptiles probably could not flap their wings very well, nor fly up from the ground. They had to take off from a tree or a cliff. Then away they went, gliding on the wind. Flyers of another kind were covered with feathers. They, too, had claws at the crook of the wing. Their jaws were studded with teeth. They had a long tail with feathers along the sides. These creatures came from reptiles, but they were not reptiles. They were the first birds. 
While one branch of the reptiles became birds, an- other branch became hair-covered animals. The first of these were tiny things that lived in the trees, hunting insects. The young ones could not feed themselves. Their mother took care of them and nursed them, for she had milk glands. These creatures were the first milk-feeders, or mammals. Both the mammals and the birds were warm-blooded. This means that their bodies were usually warmer than the air or water around them.
Young mammals and birds had to be kept warm be- fore they were born. Birds sat on their eggs to keep the young ones warm. Most mammals did not lay eggs. Baby mammals grew inside their mother’s body, and there they were snug and warm. Reptiles were cold-blooded. When the weather turned cold, they became cold. This made them slow and sluggish. They couldn’t go looking for food. There came a time when the climate of most of the world grew cold. Then the dinosaurs had a hard time. They lay down, stiff and helpless, and went hungry. Mil- lions starved. Finally, the last dinosaur died. But the birds and the mammals stayed warm and lively, fed themselves, and lived.
In the time of the early mammals, great forests covered the land. Many of the forest plants were like pine trees. They had no flowers, just cones. Grains of pollen fell from these plants and drifted away with the wind. When pollen dropped into a cone of the same kind of plant, seeds began to form. Other plants had tiny green flowers dusted with pollen. When the pollen was ripe, the wind carried it away. Some plants bore large, sweet-scented flowers. In- sects came to them looking for pollen. When a bee or an ant crawled into a flower, it would get pollen on its body. Then, if it went to another flower, the pollen would rub off there, and seeds would begin to form. Butterflies sipped the drops of sweet nectar in flowers, and carried pollen from blossom to blossom. Humming- birds, too, sipped nectar and carried pollen. The birds and the insects ate well; the plants grew well. Flowers bloomed in forest and meadow, brightening the world with their rainbow colors.
Some of the early mammals stayed in the trees. Others came down and made their homes on the ground, where they lived very well. From them, new kinds of mammals gradually developed. All were four-legged and five-toed. And all walked on the flat of their paw, as the bear does today. Yet there were differences among them. Creatures of one group were squatty in build, with a long, heavy tail. Their toenails were thick and broad, like small hoofs. Their teeth were shaped for chewing leaves, though they would also do for tearing flesh. From this we know that the beasts fed mainly on plants. But when they found a dead animal, they probably ate that, too. Such creatures were ancestors of the leaf-eating, hoofed animals like cattle and deer. Other mammals had sharper teeth, for tearing flesh. From these creatures came the flesh-eaters of later times.
Among the leaf-eaters in the forest was a little creature the size of a fox terrier. This animal was not five-toed, like its ancestors. It had four toes on its front feet and three on its hind feet. Its toenails were small hoofs. The first time scientists found a fossil of this creature, they had no idea what it was. Later they dug up bones of an animal like it, but as big as a collie. It had three toes on each foot. The middle toe was much larger than the others, and ended with a big hoof. This hoof showed that the animal was a horse. Now the scientists knew what the little woodland creature was. It was the world's first horse. During the time of the three-toed horse, many lands became too dry for trees. Forests died away. Grass took the place of the trees, and spread over the plains. The grass was tough and gritty. When horses chewed it, their teeth wore down. Then they couldn't eat any more, and they starved. But some horses had teeth that kept on growing as fast as they wore down. These horses became eaters of grass, and grew large and strong.
The story of other hoofed animals is like the story of the horse. Ancestors of the sheep, the goat, the cow, the antelope, the camel, and the rhinoceros were little woodland creatures with flat paws. As forests died away, they became creatures of the grassy plains. They rose up on their toes, and then on their toenails, which became hoofs. As their legs grew longer, they ran more swiftly. The hoofed animals had to be swift, for dangerous enemies hunted them. These were flesh-eaters of the cat and the dog families. They, like the leaf-eaters, rose on their toes and became long-legged. They developed long, sharp teeth for tearing flesh. The cats hunted by sneaking up on their prey. The dogs and wolves hunted in packs, running their prey to the ground. By the time these creatures appeared, the Earth was old. Plains and mountains looked as they do now. Forests and grasslands were like those of today, and modern kinds of creatures lived everywhere.
The world was like the world we know—and yet it was not the same. No city stood anywhere.  There was no house in the world, nor a road. There was not a single work of human hands, for there were no people. And that is The family of man was still to come. another wonderful story.
