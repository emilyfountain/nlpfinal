Pat learns about wild peppermint
Pat is a little girl. She lives with her grandmother and grandfather. They live on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Montana.
One day her grandma said, "I'm going to the meadow where Grandpa is cutting hay. Would you like to come with me?” "Oh, yes!” said Pat.
Grandma and Pat began to walk toward the meadow in Big Badger Valley. “We will eat lunch with Grandpa. Then we will go pick wild peppermint,” said Grandma. “What is wild peppermint?” asked Pat. "Just wait, my girl, and I will tell you about wild peppermint. And I will show you how it is used.”
Grandma, Grandpa and Pat ate a nice lunch. Pat felt very happy.
When they were finished Grandma said, “We will go now, my girl, and look for wild peppermint.”
“Where will we look for wild peppermint?” asked Pat. "It grows near water, usually by a stream or river.” said Grandma. "It grows in meadows.”
 “Wild peppermint is about eight to twelve inches tall.” said Grandma. “It has green leaves. It sometimes has little purple flowers. It smells good.”
They continued to walk along the stream in Big Badger Valley. "Hm-m-m, Grandma, it smells good here.” said Pat. "We are getting close to wild peppermint,” said Grandma. “And now I see it.” 
“The best time to pick wild peppermint is in the late spring or early fall,” said Grandma. And they began to pick the wild peppermint.
Grandma and Pat had fun picking the wild peppermint. After they were done, they went back home to prepare it for use during the winter.
“Grandma, what are you going to do now?" asked Pat. "We are going to tie string around the wild peppermint said Grandma. 
"We will hang the wild peppermint up to dry. We will use it this winter. Some of it we will use now.”
“What will you use the wild peppermint for?” asked Pat.
"Grandpa will use it for some of his Indian religious ceremonies.”
I will use it for medicine when you are sick. 
“I will also boil some fat and put the wild peppermint in it. The wild peppermint will flavor the boiled fat. It will taste delicious to eat with meat.”
"I will make wild peppermint tea to drink with our meal. I will mix water and wild peppermint together to drink.”
“My little girl, I want you to remember what I have shown you. Someday Grandma will be gone from you. When the Great Spirit calls me, I will leave you.” said Grandma.
“Oh, Grandma! I’m so lucky to have you,” cried Pat. “And I’m so lucky to have you, my girl,” replied Grandma. 
"You must go to sleep now. I will wake you up when Grandpa comes home.”
"Have a nice sleep now. It has been a good day.”
