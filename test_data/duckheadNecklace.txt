Duckhead Necklace and Indian Love Story
One evening two Indian girls sat outside looking at the stars. One star was very bright. "I wish that bright star would come down and marry me,” one of the girls said. The next evening a young Indian man came from an opening in the sky. He was a handsome and nicely dressed man. He took the young girl back with him into the sky and they were married.
He took her to live in a very beautiful place. She was happy and enjoyed everything. There were many things for her to do. She could do anything she wanted but there was one exception. She was told not to dig large green turnips. After awhile she became lonesome. She took long walks looking for the hole in the sky. One day she realized she was to have a baby. This made her even more homesick. On one of her walks she found some big green turnips. Even though she was told not to, she dug one up. It left a large hole. She looked down and saw the place where she used to live. She made plans to go back. Every time her husband brought game home she tanned only part of the hide. She cut the rest of the hide into strips and dried them to make a rawhide rope. She was trying to hurry as it was almost time to have her baby and she wanted to be home when the baby was born.
When she thought she had enough rawhide, she tied the strips together and made a long rope. Once the rope was finished she went to the hole. She tied one end of the rope to a rock and the other end around her waist. Slowly she let herself down through the hole. The rope wasn't long enough and she was left hanging in mid-air. When her husband came home he discovered she was missing. He looked everywhere. Finally, he discovered the hole in the sky. There he found her hanging at the end of the rawhide rope. He picked up a rock and said, “Split her in two but don't hurt the baby.” He threw the rock down and hit the woman. She fell to the ground and died. The baby boy was also hurt, but he stayed by his mother until he could walk.
There was an old woman living in a tepee not very far from the little boy. She knew there was a child living near her. One day she wanted to find out if the child was a boy or girl. She placed a doll and a bow and some arrows near the child's home. The next time she went to look, the bow and arrows were gone so she knew the child was a boy.
One day the boy walked to the end of a forest. He saw a lone tepee. When he was close to it a voice called, “Come in my grandchild. I have been expecting you.” The little boy went in and sat down. He saw an old woman sitting opposite him. She told him to stay with her. He had the bow and arrows she had left. She taught him how to use the bow and arrows. She tied a duck head on a buckskin string and put it around the little boy's neck. She told him it would protect him at all times. His name would be Duckhead Necklace.
Sometimes he went hunting for small animals and birds. Often he was lucky and he would kill a sage hen, duck, bush rabbit, prairie chicken or other small animals. His grandmother was very proud. One day he came to a big lake. He saw a large whale swimming around. He shot and killed it with his bow and arrow. He returned to his grandmother's tepee and told her what he had done. Grandmother left saying she was going after firewood. She did not return for several days. This happened many times. Each time she came back her hair would be hanging loose and her arms and her legs were scratched and bleeding. Long ago,that is how Indians mourned for someone they had lost. Duckhead Necklace's grandmother was in mourning. In those days animals could change to people and people could change into animals. Duckhead Necklace had killed a whale. The whale he had killed was his grandmother's husband. Duckhead Necklace was very sorry. He did not know the whale was his grandmother's husband.
One day when Duckhead Necklace was walking, he came to a tepee. From inside a voice told him to come in and sit down at the head of a circle of young men. Each man took turns telling him stories, hoping to put him to sleep. Duckhead Necklace went to sleep right away, but while he slept the duck head hanging around his neck was saying “Yes” for Duckhead Necklace. In the Indian way, as long as someone says yes, the stories go on and on. These young men planned to kill Duckhead Necklace after they had put him to sleep. The young men were actually snakes. Duckhead Necklace woke up and heard their plan. He grabbed one of them with his hands. Stroking the snake from his neck down to his tail he said, "You are to crawl on the ground always.” In turn, the snakes told him never to drink from a buffalo wallow (which is water standing in small pools). Duckhead Necklace left. Whenever he came to a buffalo wallow, even though he was thirsty, he always remembered not to drink.
After many days had passed, Duckhead Necklace thought, "It's been a long time since I was told not to drink from buffalo wallows. I don't think anything will happen now.” When he took a drink a snake entered his body and settled in his head. The snake did not come out. Duckhead Necklace's body turned into a skeleton. Still the snake stayed. The snake finally came out. When this happened, Duckhead Necklace returned to life. He grabbed the snake rubbing its nose on a stone, making it flat and he told him, "You will have a flat nose forever.” Duckhead Necklace traveled until he discovered a village. He sat on a hill and watched the camp. He noticed bears and people living together. He went down to the first tepee and went in. The people told him to sit down. They gave him something to eat. After eating, the men smoked. The people told him that at first everyone got along just fine, but now the bears took most of the meat and they left the rest to spoil. "People are starving and we can't do anything about it,” the men told Duckhead Necklace.
Duckhead Necklace went to the bear chief's tepee and told him he was doing wrong by starving the people. Duckhead Necklace ordered the bears to leave and go live in the mountain forest. He also took their talking away. When the bears moved away, the people settled down to a peaceful life. After living in the village awhile Duckhead Necklace decided to travel on.
Duckhead Necklace walked along until he came to another village. There the people lived with beautiful white birds. For awhile when the men hunted, everyone shared equally. As the white birds became bolder, they began taking more of the meat the men brought back from hunting. The people told Duckhead Necklace, “The birds have taken over. They eat what they want and leave the rest of the meat to spoil. People are starving.” Duckhead Necklace went to the bird chief's tepee and asked the birds to move away. The bird chief refused. He was satisfied with the way they were living. Duckhead Necklace asked several times but each time the birds refused.
The next time the men went hunting, Duckhead Necklace went along. He changed himself into a buffalo calf and told the men to shoot him. They did. The white birds came to eat the meat the men had killed. The bird chief chose the buffalo calf. He flew down and landed on the calf. As soon as he landed Duckhead Necklace grabbed him. With his hands he stroked the bird chief from his head to the end of his tail. The bird chief turned black. These birds became known as ra- vens. Duckhead Necklace also took their talking away. The birds could no longer rule the people. The people were very happy and said many good things about Duckhead Necklace. Duckhead Necklace knew his grandmother would be proud to know he was doing good things for other people.
This is a true story. It happened hundreds of years ago, back in the days of the buffalo when the Indians roamed this country freely. In those days Indian people of different tribes did not understand each other’s language. They fought each other some of the time. The fighting brought honor to the victor. An Indian who earned many coups from his enemy was consid- ered a chief. What the whiteman calls a horse thief, long ago was considered honorable in the Indian society. The Indians made horse raids and advised the younger people who had horses not to be sleepy heads. “If you sleep late and don’t wake up at night, you are going to go around by foot. You won’t have any horses if you sleep too long. You will be easy prey for enemies.” 
There was a young Indian man who was the only child of a married couple. He met a young Indian girl who was one of two children. The young man fell in love with this young girl. They talked of love but never touched each other. They would stand many feet apart, just close enough to hear what was being said to each other. Time went on and there was to be a war party. The young man wanted to see his sweetheart before he left. After sundown he went to his girlfriend's camp. He went near her tepee and the girl came out. She waited to hear what he had to say. The young man said, "I came to tell you that tomorrow night a war party is leaving. I want to go. I want to make something of myself. When I come back we will talk to our parents and perhaps we can marry.” While the man was talking the girl never said anything. She just bowed her head. After he stopped talking the girl said, "Is that all you wanted to tell me?” The young man said, "Yes.” "Listen,” she said, "you are suggesting you want honor so people will recognize you, maybe as a chief. Why do you want that? Your father is a great chief, a respected man. People respect you as much as they respect your father. You don't have to go. Some people who go on war parties never come back. What if that happens to you? What's going to happen to me? My heart and my beliefs are for you. My love is for you. If I lose you I'm nothing. I don't think I will go on living. I love you that much. I don't want you to go. You don't need anything else than what you have now. You are respected already. You ride good horses. You wear good clothes. You have plenty to eat. You live in a good tepee with your father and mother. What more do you want?”
The man said, “I know but that isn't enough for me. I want a name for myself before I ask for a wife. I just have to go.” They argued back and forth. Finally, the girl gave up. She never said anything. She just stood there and hung her head. It was dark so the young man could not see if the girl was crying.
He went to his tepee and put on a good robe fixed with porcupine quill work. It was fancy, one of the best robes. He took the robe back to the girl. “I’m going to go,” he said. “While I’m gone I want you to keep this. When I come back I want to see this blanket and you. We will get married if our parents consent.” He left. He didn't kiss her, because they didn't do that in those days. The girl just stood there while he disappeared into the darkness. 
The next night the war party went looking for their enemy. They found them and fought. The young man killed an enemy and took his scalp and other things for coups. They won the fight and started back. The return trip took many days.
One day they approached an old camp, the same camp they had left some days before. The young man began looking around the campsite. He walked to the river and came back saying, “I found something. While we were gone someone must have died. The person was buried in a tepee in the woods over there.”
The young man felt uneasy about talking about someone who had passed away. “I’ll go over there and look,” he said. When he came to the side of the tepee, his heart fell but he didn't cry. The tepee was staked down solid all around. The doorway was entwined with sticks so wolves, or coyotes could not get inside the tepee and eat the dead person. He undid all the twigs and sticks and peeked inside. As soon as he stuck his head inside the doorway he recognized his blanket. There his sweetheart lay dead, covered with the blanket. When he saw this he wanted to make sure. He went over to the body and uncovered the face. Sure enough, it was his sweetheart. He went back to his war party.
He said, “The dead person is the girl who told me not to go on the war party. It is the girl I promised to marry when I came back. She told me if I didn't listen to her and stay, she would die of loneliness. She told the truth. She died because of me. I’m the one who caused it. I’m going to stay here with her. She's a woman and she's out here all by herself. I'm a man and I should be with her.” A wise man in the war party said, "No, don't do that. She's been gone for a long time. Come back with us. These things happen. If you stay here you can't bring her back. It's just going to be harder on you.” But the young man just wouldn't accept it. Finally, the wise man said, "All right then. You stay but don't harm yourself because of her. She's in the happy hunting grounds with the rest of her relatives who have gone before her.” "No, I won't do anything. I just want to stay with her for four days,” the young man said. "Take the horses and the scalp that I have and give them to my father. Tell him what I am doing and that I’m going to come back.” The men left him and he went back to the camp, the burial grounds. He went inside the tepee and crawled in beside his sweetheart. The man's body touched her dead body as he lay there. The first night he didn't sleep a wink. The second night he was able to sleep a little and the third night he slept well. The fourth night he slept soundly. That morning he heard movement inside the tepee and a fire was burning. The burning fire was crackling. He just lay there because he thought he was dreaming. Suddenly, he heard a woman's voice. "Get up. You're going to eat,” she said. Still he lay there. He still thought he was dreaming. Again the woman spoke and the fourth time he opened his eyes. There was a fire in the middle of the tepee. There was also food cooking. His sweetheart was sitting by the fire.
She said, “My folks sent me some food and we are going to eat. But before we eat I want to tell you this. I told you what was going to happen. Now you sleep by me. You don't fear me. You don't hate me. I pitied you. After we eat we're going home to your people, my people.” She looked like she did when she was alive. She had good clothes and nicely combed hair. After they ate she said, “When we go out, fix this doorway the way you found it. Fix it so no animal can get in here.”
They went to find their families. They traveled day after day. Finally the girl asked, "Are you hungry?” The young man said, "Yes, I'm hungry now.” "Well, do you see that herd of buffalo over there? Go over there and kill a fat young buffalo. They won't see you because I will give you my power,” she said. He killed the buffalo. They cut out the best parts and cooked them. Their journey home continued day after day. The summer sky was clear. The grass was green and trees by the river were covered with green leaves. Every now and then they saw a herd of buffalo. The buffalo would not pay any attention to them. They could not see them because the young woman gave the man special power.
They continued to travel until one day they came upon a high ridge. Far below by a river was a large camp. The girl said, “Here are our people. Our parents live in this camp. We are going down there but I want you to go to your parent's place. That is where you belong anyway.” They started down the ridge to the camp. As soon as they came close to the encampment all the dogs barked and barked. They smelled something and ran in the opposite direction. The dogs knew a soul was coming alongside the young man. That was why they barked. The people felt strange. A man was coming and the dogs were barking at him. The dogs had never done that before.
The young man went to his parent's tepee. His mother was very glad to see him. She hung onto her son and cried. She said, "My son, I’m glad you came back. We heard what you did and we were scared. Our enemies are still nearby. I’m glad you came back. Sit down and drink some water. I will feed you.” He sat down on his bed. His parents had fixed it just like he had been sleeping on it. When he sat down, his sweetheart sat down beside him. The people could not see her because a soul cannot be seen by a living person. The young man's mother began to feed him. "Your father just killed a young buffalo and we have good meat,” she said. She fed him and put some water beside the food. Before he ate, he took the water and food and put it beside him in front of the girl. He continued talking to his parents and after awhile he took the food and ate it. Every time they fed him he did that. He wouldn't touch the food and water until he placed it on his left side. His mother noticed the strange way he was acting. One day after the young man had gone outside, his father came in. The mother said, "Our son has been acting very strangely. He never acted like this before. I have noticed his strange ways since he came back.”
After awhile the young man came back to his mother's tepee. The girl's soul went wherever he went. His mother said, “My son, you’ve been acting very strangely. Tell us, why you are acting like this?” The young man said, “Mother, the girl that passed away at the old camp is with me. She's right here.” When he said that, the girl smiled. After that his mother set two places, one for the girl's soul and one for her son. When his mother did this the girl was very happy.
The young man would eat everything, but the girl's food was always left uneaten. Time went on until a war party was getting ready to leave. The girl said to the young man, "You have to make a name for yourself.so we must go along. You said you liked horses. It is time to get some.” They went in broad daylight and took horses from the enemy. It was as if the horses strayed off by themselves. No one could see the man because the girl gave him the power to be invisible. He made many horse raids, each time getting many horses. He be- came a great chief. 
The girl's soul stayed with the young man for four years. One day the girl said, "I promised I would live with you for four years. Now four years are up and everything you have been wishing for on this earth you now have. I cannot stay longer than I promised so this is the end. I have a sister. She is a very beautiful woman. I want you to marry her and always be good to her. She will take my place. I want you to love my sister as much as you have loved me. You and she are going to have a very good life from this day on. Take my sister as your wife and always respect her.” The young man told his mother what the girl had said. His mother went to the girl's parents and talked with them. They were willing and happy. "These are our departed daughter's words and we cannot refuse them. We will do as she wishes.” They had a big gathering among the young man's relatives and friends, as well as the bride's relatives and friends. Both families exchanged gifts. The couple was married by an old warrior who performed the ceremony. They lived a long and happy life.
