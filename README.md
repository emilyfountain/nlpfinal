Get hype, its the reading level analysis and classifier project !!!

loadcorpus.py has become basically my driver file, since i have written out
most of my tests and stuff in there.

classify_text is meant to hold all the methods that have to do with the
actual classification--then i run those methods from loadcorpus.py.
But please play around with that because i just chose that arbitrarily.
